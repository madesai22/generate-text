";"How did physical geography impact industrial growth?

Physical geography is a key determinant of productivity and business expansion, making it hard to predict where things will end up (and how quickly). As for productivity, the most important question is how much work will be done on an hour to a day basis and how much will be done on a week to a day basis. It's a question that has been at the heart of our job in many fields for decades. I was fortunate enough to work at a company that actually knew many of the same things about its working people, as well as those of its staff. When there's a large number of people working on a daily basis, a large number of people have the time to get their hands dirty. What about how much work will be done on an hour to a day basis to get a good starting point and how much work will be done on a week to a day basis? We've all heard of the ""free lunch"" concept for productivity, but the question is, do you find it effective to do it in the right period of time? So, more fundamentally, I think physical geography is a key determinant of productivity and business expansion.

On why this should matter in the long-run

At the same time, as the world economy evolves, a lot of the factors that we consider important to the future are changing. There's going to be a lot more people who want to be people, and we need more people with the skills and knowledge to make that"

There are a lot of new ideas.

We have a lot of new inventions. In the late 70s and early 80s, what was the basic premise of inventing? [and] the idea of doing something we could do today?

That's what I wanted to be a part of. I wanted to do something that we could do, and do things that were not possible before.

So I worked on a company called Cabbage. He was the first person to really think of it as something that could be done.

And how did the invention of the transistor come about?

It's very difficult to pin down the exact sequence of events, but I think an early event is the transistor, with all its power.

When the word 'transistor' popped out of Webster's dictionary, it meant the electric motor that was powering that motor was connected to the transistor, so that the transistor was connected to the motor.

In 1950, a patent for a transistor started to appear on a patent for a ""wireless switch circuit"" [a device that takes power from the transistor]. The name was probably not the same, but he was making it up! It gave a lot of power to the transistor, and it then started to do the crazy kind of stuff.

But with every transistor, the transistor became a more advanced invention.

";"How did the government interact with big business?

The government used the information it got from the public to put restrictions on the activities of big businesses. It allowed the government to block businesses, the government tried to regulate them and impose sanctions that were only applied to businesses.

How have your ideas and recommendations influenced business in India today?

The government believes in creating greater prosperity for all the citizens by not restricting themselves to being a part of a particular religion or tradition. We think businesses will make better use of the information they get from the government so that they can make their own decisions.

Why did you decide to move this project out of the office of the Minister of Education to a new government?

We were inspired by the economic impact of the project. We know that the government was also motivated by the need to encourage entrepreneurship in the country. If it weren't for the strong job growth that is happening in manufacturing industries, for example, then we would have never been able to compete.

The government also felt that India could remain on the business-led agenda without the government. But there is a desire to move on from business and it is not a dream that can be put forward with the kind of support that we have been getting.

Would you like to think about how you'd respond to a potential government challenge?

I'd like to think what might happen could be very significant for India. I have always said that the government will have a responsibility to provide support for the economy and"

";"How did urban development change the landscape of America?

Rajendra K. Bholakia

One of the most controversial issues of our time, this question has become increasingly the subject of debate. The idea that urban development had changed the landscape of America and other countries has long been viewed as a hoax that was fabricated by the mainstream media and the American public. This is based on a simple premise, the ""Gang of Eighties"". A group known colloquially as the Gang of Eighties who began in 1950, was comprised of three of the most influential people in American politics, and the three influential people who had the power to change the landscape of urban America were: Charles Manson of the Manson Family, James Earl Ray Ray, and Ronald Reagan.

If you look at the media coverage in 1950, the most prominent of these men was the media commentator Bill O'Reilly, who gave an interview with the Washington Post for about ten minutes saying that most of the US was ""over the top"" of the problem of crime.

I remember once a time, when, as a child I was about eight, I spent a week in a house on the streets looking at the TV screen and watching the TV programs on the black market to see if we could see what the black market had to do with crime. For the next day or so, I would go to the house and watch that show. I would watch this show all day long and watch like, ""Oh my God, we have to make a big"

";"How did race, gender and social status aﬀect American politics?

We've gotten our fair share of criticism online and across the Internet for being biased toward candidates not on their race. But there've also been the instances of race in politics that don't necessarily relate to their place in history. The story of Trayvon Martin shows that our race has something to do with this:

A video of George Zimmerman's confrontation with Eric Garner showed he struggled to get his hands on an assault weapon.

What does all race have to do with race?

We don't fully grasp the exact relationship between ethnicity and race until we talk about race. Race, like ethnicity, can have effects on how we see ourselves. In a recent paper, Andrew Y. Weil, PhD, and Erika J. Gautier, A.S., A.V., and B.J. Williams, MArch in Developmental Epidemiology, Social Issues, Vol. 12, No. 5, May 2007, published by the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, found that racial minorities generally experienced increased exposure to ""external stimuli"" such as their peers in the first place. They also experienced lower rates of anxiety, depression, and the like in the presence of people who weren't from the same race. A 2007 study of black college students in the United States found that two-thirds had experienced racial discrimination during class in one of five academic disciplines: science, engineering, or mathematics.

";"How do the maps above demonstrate that the United States was geographically ready for the Industrial Revolution?

If that's so, the maps above should be useful, but we don't have any evidence that this was done. The maps are based on a lot of hard data. They're all fairly old. It's difficult to imagine how something like this could happen at such a small scale. Yet even if we could do a full-scale map, the models are still relatively small.

So, what's the likelihood that the United States was ready to develop, at least to some extent, an industrial revolution. Will it do so on the scale of the Industrial Revolution or just as a gradual transition of technological development?

This is an interesting question, because many people question why the United States was developing industrial products at such a young age – the question is whether the Industrial Revolution was gradual or, rather, rapid.

It's possible that we don't do what we need to but to have something as gradual as that. I have a very good feeling for that. In fact, it's worth comparing the two. The Industrial Revolution (imagine) was relatively early, but industrial products took a pretty long time to mature. If you had just done industrial manufacturing you probably wouldn't know the first 10 or 20 years.

A century of manufacturing growth took about a decade. So industrial products are evolving and they may do things that you haven't done before.

You have an industrial revolution? The Civil War was certainly a period long ago, but a war"

I've met him in London a few times and once asked Andrew why he thinks the rich and powerful keep spending so much money when he was a young, very powerful mayor of London and he didn't get much advice in return. People who were born and raised in the US, he said, they are very strong people and they are very strong. He really wasn't the first person to say that.

But I think Andrew has found some very good ideas for how we can deal with some of the issues facing us and also for how we can solve some of the problems facing us, about what we can do about inequality. And I think he has a very good point about how we can address the problem of the wealthiest 10 percent, and what that means for our country.

";"What part of the American identity does Carnegie emphasize in this document?

I think the American identity, in essence, says that if you want to be something, you have to do something. I see the world in general as a very difficult work, a very high-stakes, very difficult work. But I don't think, as an economist, that a person has to do anything very hard. I don't think that that's a thing.

A lot of the things they do is hard to understand. What does that tell you about their methodology?

The other thing is that it tells us how to understand the world. I have heard from people who were doing economics who had just become economists and they had to put on a hat and do a hatchet job. There's a great story in New York City where it was about a man named George Monbiot. He actually got an order here, the Chicago Business Improvement Agency, that the Department of Justice was investigating.

And there's a new story, which is this whole notion that the whole kind of system was really broken because it doesn't work. Look, you are one of the lucky people that can do a hatchet job. You can see these people all over the country doing it. Now, when I was working for the Department of Justice, we had this new law.

If it doesn't, it's as if we live in the moment, a time of self-destruction, a time for ""the middle class"" (a point that has been widely debunked—but which we have also used to mock the American way of life). The first of the Big Eight, the last in the G-20 and the first in the EECS, is a real threat to the middle class. While they have a stake in our prosperity, they also want a world-wide debt-limit of $20 trillion. There are many reasons why America would want to shut down the central bank and the International Monetary Fund. But the biggest is that the ""middle class"" can't even afford it. It's a huge number of people—a number that is more than sufficient to bring down the country.

By the way, there is no other explanation as to why the ""new"" American system would be such a disaster. It certainly doesn't make sense to think anything of how the American Dream is supposed to be lived. It makes sense, in principle. But it just doesn't work for most Americans.

Why? Because most people aren't willing to accept it.

Detroit has a bad reputation for its bad reputation. The average Michigan citizen lives in Detroit and they are not paying taxes there. They are just working their asses off and doing nothing. So Detroit needs to change their behavior.

If they are going to grow their business and they want to keep the people that reside in Detroit healthy then that is a great way to put Detroit in the league in terms of growth.

A. It changed. The labor movement changed. The economy changed. The country changed. During this period, labor was in flux. It was in this realm of being a part of production that people would not move away from it. This was an era where we had to be able to make it all happen. But it was never really a time when everything was as it was. And the economic system didn't work out that well.

Today, people work more hours than many of their parents did, which enables them to spend less time worrying about the world and more time doing stuff.

";"To what extent did labor beneﬁt from the Industrial Revolution?

The average American was well to a job. The number of people who worked was increasing quickly. People were taking over those jobs. In fact, as recently as 1854, only 5% were employed. The median worker became an industrialist for the first time.

Of all the occupations, the most popular was agriculture. The number of farmers was 8.3% in 1854. During the Great Depression, the average income for workers in the United States rose to almost $35,000.

But if the work that was just getting done was still there to pay the bills, then the total amount needed to pay the bills was even higher. The average family income per worker in 1850 stood at $27,000. After the Great Depression, the total worker income per family rose to $27,000.

It is clear that the number of people employed, regardless of whether it was for a factory or what it did, was increasing rapidly. In 1860, there were 7 million unemployed workers! During the same period, there were 5.7 million workers of this type being employed!

The Industrial Revolution started in the United States in 1789, the year the first ""laborers' strike"" took place.

From the beginning of the Obama administration, the government has been involved in the economy. During the recession period, the government provided assistance to many rural and working classes. During the recovery and recovery from the Great Recession, government support for agriculture and services, including home care, went up. The government also provided more and more federal programs, including housing assistance and unemployment benefits. The growth of the federal minimum wage dropped dramatically, and the overall federal government went through a real economic boom.

The real question still is, do we believe that government-paid government help is a legitimate form of economic assistance? If so, which government assistance programs do we believe are appropriate for this class? And, to what extent do we think the programs are in fact government-supported? As a result of these questions and many other factors, how would public support for the government services and programs be different for the class of borrowers who receive government-funded work?

A strong and robust public support for government-funded work can be achieved by including government-funded work in any single way. In the case of public assistance to borrowers, the amount of Federal support would be reduced drastically. In a recent article in the American Enterprise Institute, for example, the public expects government-funded work to continue to be ""the norm for most of our lives."" Further, in fact, the public expects government-funded work to continue to be among the most popular programs in the nation.

First, Bryan has no other complaints than his lack of respect for fellow citizens' right to speak (he's just not sure if that's a real complaint). Second, Bryan is an authoritarian who thinks he makes a living in the American West, as if he were the leader of a nation he doesn't own. And third, he's not a natural speaker, nor is his wife, nor does his sister, nor does anyone else, except the most basic and fundamental principle of American democracy – that the right to speak is a right and everyone has an obligation to hold it.

C Bryan doesn't do that, so he's not a representative of the United States. There's been ample evidence of his overreaching in promoting his agenda to the highest levels. So, what does he say?

What he claims is that the free society of the United States should be an America that embraces liberty, freedom of religion and association, freedom of speech, free markets, fair work, individual responsibility. In Bryan's view, that includes liberty, freedom of speech, and the right to vote. But he doesn't give what he claims is a principled argument for that liberty in this speech. Instead, he offers a false one.

He admits that this speech is ""stirring the conscience of many,"" but he doesn't say that by ""stirring the conscience of other religious minorities."" The speech he gives is an exercise of religious doctrine in ""secular practice,"""
17;"How does he compare farmers to those on the Atlantic Coast?
";"How does he compare farmers to those on the Atlantic Coast?

The answer seems to lie in the way farmers feel about climate change. Farmers are far more likely to say climate change is good than scientists, that's for sure. For example, according to the National Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, climate change is not only a national problem, it is already causing major changes to agriculture. By 2050, that's more than half the land on Earth that humans would occupy within the next 40 years, and nearly all of that land would be covered by trees. In the 1960s, the United States took in more than 1 percent of the oceans and over one-quarter of the land. By 2050, that was more than two-thirds of all land on Earth.

But farmers are also far more pessimistic about the consequences of climate change. They are more skeptical that the United States should be worried about rising seas, for example, and less worried about climate change in general.

What are farmers concerned about? And is there a need for them to say so?

Many farmers in their state aren't worried about the potential impacts of climate change. In rural areas, more than half of the land on the planet is protected from glaciers for at least 20 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And many of rural states, like New York, have already raised their property tax rates to a much higher level than their national average.

It is clear that the question of the Populist Party stands, now and in the future, in the interests of our nation. With this in mind, our party needs to be able to stand out in support of our national interests. How does this speech represent the aims of the Populist Party? Well, as I have said, it shows that the present Populist Party is being run by a small group of people, a group that is very inexperienced in the fields of journalism and the public debate.

I have mentioned two other important factors that may help put this speech into practice. First, the Populist Party has its own constituency outside of the local Populist Party. The Populist Party is also the party of the same name, which means that the Populists of today are more diverse than in the past. The Populists believe that the Party cannot ever be seen simply as any other party or organisation.

To put this another way, the Populist Party is a party of unity, a party that believes in the democratic process and an effective electoral process. If we are going to be a Populism, this government must be able to make the Populist Party part of the government and part of the government must be able to do things differently from the government. There are several reasons why this must be done. The first is that the Populists believe that there can be no two parties in the whole world"

The answer was that they were too young to understand politics or English, so they were educated at a highly selective one (read: no good job prospects). As a consequence, they were born illiterate but were more likely to take a different path from other immigrants than their children.

There has, since then, been a growing trend whereby Asians are arriving from more and more diverse cities, and more and more Asian immigrants are heading to the US. But the American Dream has been stalled.

The American Dream is a dream that's been in the American Dream since at least the 1880s. You couldn't get rich in the US without a good education. You couldn't get much education without spending thousands in college without going to college. You couldn't get much of anything without going to college.

In the 21st century, that hasn't changed. This is the era of the young American Dream, when we've seen the return of manufacturing jobs, and we're looking at a boom, in the form of new manufacturing jobs that are coming back on our campuses.

The only way to go back to that dream is to do what all the other immigrants have done and build a better economy that works better for all Americans. It requires people to learn about foreign policy and understanding both American history and the world around us.

By increasing our defense spending. We are spending significantly more than the budget for our military. In fact, we've spent over the past three years reducing our military budgets.

We have cut more than four times as much as our military budget. We have brought that total down from $43 billion in 1999 to just under $16 billion today.

And what we need to do is look at all the ways that the United States, as a nation, can go about combating terrorism. We need to make sure we use a broad range of weapons that have a very high standard of effectiveness. We need to use other forms of sophisticated attack to reduce the effectiveness of terrorist groups, and we need to strengthen our ability to carry out our national security interests and protect our diplomats.

We need to do everything in our power to identify and eliminate weapons of mass destruction.

We need to be on the lookout for ways to expand the use of weapons of limited effectiveness. We need to ensure that we have a force that can be relied upon to deal with, with, with each of our adversaries. We need to build the capacity to act and protect against international terrorism.

In the last six years in Israel, we have seen a very, very high level of polarization and an unprecedented level of violence against Palestinians. Of course, we have had a very strong experience in this region, an even stronger experience in the Middle East, not only at the expense of our rights, but in the context of a very dangerous situation. But we have also witnessed a very weak state; we just haven't seen it since 1948. The main problem is that Israel is not having a good relationship with the United States. The U.S. supports Israel in the Middle East—the Middle East, Israel. These people are not being treated to the same human rights that they were here. We have been supporting the people of Palestine for 70 years, and there are people in the military who are fighting for the right to freedom of expression and the self-determination of all people. And not surprisingly, there are things that seem to be happening.

";"What potential problems can you identify in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory that may have contributed to the death of so many workers?

I believe, for example, there is a connection between the quality and quantity of a garment in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory and the number of workers who died from heart attacks and strokes. It is possible that the average working age of workers in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory is lower than that of workers in the large textile textile factories in China, where there is relatively high productivity and a high concentration of workers on the wage ladder, and that is the cause of the death (rather than the cause of work stoppage):

From a safety perspective, it cannot be that the number of workers who died at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in China was substantially higher in the early 2000s than it is today, and that they died from heart attack and stroke. The reasons for this are not clear.

We certainly hope that the public has some idea of the extent to which the textile workers had been affected by some of the major events that occurred over the three years since the 2002 Tianjin International (the last time in which the government announced measures to improve working conditions for other people's groups). That will be important for workers' safety; we hope we can help raise the awareness of the cause of death to those who have no idea how to work in factories of cotton, wool, and linen that are designed to carry heavy loads with little or no ventilation, and in which hundreds of people are employed and die in accidents.
