";"How did physical geography impact industrial growth?

As part of the growth strategy published in 2010 by the U.S. Department of Energy under the Center for Energy and Carbon Research, researchers measured energy demand by assessing the effects of different physical landscapes on production energy. The first field research into how plants could change their productivity depended on measuring the impact of different physical landscapes across the U.S.

""The first thing we're doing is going to measure changes in carbon footprint across various areas of the global climate system—from the Northern Hemisphere to Antarctica,"" says lead researcher Daniel Ebersling at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. ""This is another way that we'll quantify what we measure. I know that I'm not alone with that in my ability to do that. We're doing an exercise and it's not actually in my area of interest.""

Ebersling, now professor of geophysics at Duke University and a consultant on the program, began looking into the relationship between urban life and energy use in the early 1990s, beginning in the early 1990s with a project called Ecography: Climate Change.

""I have to tell you the things I think happened over the last three decades in terms of our country's environmental impact is really unique,"" Ebersling says in the video below. ""They have been happening over the past 14-16 years in the same way many different people have experienced their lives.""

";"How did tycoons inﬂuence the growth of corporations?

As I said in my talk with Sean I mentioned in our discussion that with any given corporation, there are a lot of factors that go into determining whether your business should operate. The more of this information your corporation has, the more difficult it becomes to get that info to the people who need it.

How did tycoons inﬂuence the growth of corporations? As this is not a big deal to me personally, I would also like to talk about the relationship between the CEO and employees in my company. These are the people who run our business. Many people say that the CEO can see and understand what my business needs and desires to achieve. What they seem to be doing with the data is a great way to see what our business needs and desires to achieve and how it should move forward as a whole.

How do tycoons inﬂuence the growth of corporations? As I mentioned in my talk with Sean the other day, my first line of defense when they get to know me is that I am not a sociopath. I will tell them that that makes them a good person to start with because they have been through similar situation. I will remember this because during the interview, they gave me a picture of me from afar in the hospital. It was very nice to meet the guy in my little hospital. He looked good and kept smiling."

";"How did inventions impact demands for labor?

As labor became more efficient, the use—whether for industrial agriculture or for other industries, depending on the individual's occupation or the context—of materials became a major problem. The industrial revolution also required an energy-intensive process of production. The process could not necessarily generate sufficient fuel for the industrial production itself, such as coal or oil, and the need for such a process was not widespread.

As a result, we must turn our attention now to the specific needs of the consumers. We must begin by thinking about whether the product we produce and sell is sufficiently low in demand to ensure the highest quality, or whether it is not sufficiently high in demand to supply the demand. From the perspective of a small group with a certain level of education and skills, it appears that the consumer's preferences may have been sufficiently small because they have not paid attention to the supply, and, therefore, have not understood the full extent of the information being offered. These needs may affect demand and productivity at a particular price in the long run, as they did in the past. The same is true of products that are available that are less expensive and less labor-intensive because people have been more responsive to the market for a given product and the market for goods that would satisfy those needs.

The use of machinery might mean different kinds of products, and in particular different types of machinery. That is, different types of machinery would not offer the same benefits"

";"How did the government interact with big business?

They didn't. But the government still did everything it could to try to make sure that Big Brother wouldn't interfere with the government's activities. And then, with the help of the NSA, they were able to access every little bit of the government's emails and files. I hope, in the next 15 years, we look back in ten to twelve years and say, 'What did we do wrong?' We're talking about the massive increase of US government surveillance under Obama. We went from the worst of what we'd had to worry about being a small country to something that was like a huge country – with the biggest intelligence agencies to get a hold of it. They did. I know that I'm not alone with that – there's almost a billion Americans who think of the NSA as the enemy. And the fact that they've spent over a million dollars fighting it means that every citizen who's lived in Washington DC, Maryland, Kansas, Nebraska, Idaho, Vermont, and Michigan, every single one in the U.S., they've been able to use it to their advantage against the enemy.

How much surveillance of the people they were able to target has happened over the last three decades in almost every sector of our lives?

";"How did urban development change the landscape of America?

As I started in 2001, my family began living in a large house with a 2,800 square foot bedroom. This was my first year living here and my first time living in Washington D.C. It was pretty hard to come by even with the government and government departments in place, but it made up for it.

Since then the D.C. Chamber of Commerce has raised more than $500,000 and has created more jobs across the country. It was the beginning of the end for me when D.C., our largest city, turned green. We were lucky to move to Atlanta with our new neighbors. I remember when the lights started. They were going at night and I thought, ""No, no, no, we're going to keep them on,"" and they responded that's what we already do.

There is just one, big, bright light from an apartment in Washington DC. No, not the TV.

Why do we need more lights? I know the majority of Americans don't realize that their city lights are not working. I will tell you why. One of the best ways to save money is to reduce the number of people who can't see or get to work.

";"How did race, gender and social status aﬀect American politics?

As I started in 2001, my political career was in a highly critical place in the political discourse. I was starting at the top but I was just beginning to appreciate the issues that I wanted to tackle by myself. The first thing to address was race, specifically race relations. I was raised in the 1930s in a Democratic South where we had the biggest Negro population in the nation and it was this great wave of segregation that we had to deal with as people of color and of the disabled. We had a very white community, but they were being segregated. We were still getting rid of the segregated house in the South and black people had to look the other way. They would drive one hundred miles up there and they could feel in the back of their head. And those of us who were from the South were in those communities and our politics was also being questioned because, in the same way, we understood race as something that comes from outside the Democratic party.

You know, I know the early work of labor leaders in the black community in North Carolina helped to make me understand. Black members of the New Deal were saying they were the people who were oppressed by race. Well, in 1963 we had the first mass-protest in South Carolina and Black people in the state had to hold off the police and the rest was history. I remember the first movement of this sort were"

";"How do the maps above demonstrate that the United States was geographically ready for the Industrial Revolution?

The map below shows that the Industrial Revolution began not in New York City but in Europe, and those regions were largely fertile for manufacturing:

The final section of the book explores the origins of the world's economic infrastructure in terms of its geography. For example, it outlines the origins of the Industrial Revolution by exploring how the French worked in France:

The French were very well armed, strong men and women, and they had no means of defending themselves. They were also the main competitors of the American bourgeoisie in Europe, and they needed the assistance of Europe's greatest wealth. While many Europeans were quite ready to defend themselves, the Americans lacked the resources to supply the Continent. The French made up much of our new frontier in Europe. Many Europeans were very proud of them, even when they were not actually in their own countries. They viewed them as very important, and, therefore, they made them great leaders. However, they could hardly get along without a good strong and proud country. If France were to have been successful enough to support the Industrial Revolution in North America, it would undoubtedly have been successful enough to become the best strong nation in the world.

The Americans, on the other hand, lacked the knowledge and ability to do so. Indeed, when World War I broke out, only two hundred German soldiers remained, and in 1848 the Americans lost the war to America"

""It's because that's the political money that determines how large each piece is -- that's the political money that determines the political system. To do your research, you know,"" says Carnegie. He looks at the real estate sector while doing the same with government. ""So far, the only people that are in a position today to have the support of money that is out there are the very wealthy. That's a pretty strong part of the pie,"" Carnegie says.

How big are the real estate companies in China today?

""There will be a lot more money out there in China,"" Carnegie says with a laugh.

Can you talk about the scale of the businesses that were successful by using Chinese money in the 1990s and '00s?

""The real estate revolution actually began as a thing that happened in China at the end of the second world war,"" adds Carnegie, before going on to say the first came about using a bunch of dollars to buy a building on the mainland.

How does Carnegie define what makes a ""Chinese business?""

""You can't count the number of companies that actually went the big and went big,"" Carnegie asks.

8;"How does Andrew Carnegie view charity?
";"How does Andrew Carnegie view charity?

Andrew Carnegie: Charity is a concept which I see in a myriad of ways in the world. The idea was that people were giving, so to do your charitable work, you wouldn't have to take your money. The first thing to do is to get that donation over there. And, in the case of welfare, then once you have the support of money such as your bank account, it's a lot easier for you to collect donations and use those as contributions.

The main difference between charities and philanthropy is that people have a higher social status. Give, charity, philanthropism are all social functions that people do. And, when you bring people together they all act one way or another, and they all feel in common. One way of doing it is of getting more people together.

I have already discussed some of these changes at length here, but, you know, in short, they're a good thing. I guess that's a good thing.

Q: I know the word charitable is a little confusing. I think some of it is about helping people, but is that something the actual notion of charity actually entails?

A: Yes, I'm sure philanthropy is a very similar concept. People would say that, you know, in the United States we're very rich; we need aid to rebuild our infrastructure. That's good, but there aren't enough people in the United States to do"

""Part of the identity lies with political institutions that control our public discourse with a power base that is rooted in what we call the social contract. And then there are those who feel that this political power stems from the government, and the government is not being served by government at all. And then there are those who feel that those powers come from the corporations, such as the American Petroleum Institute, the Koch brothers and a number of other oil and gas interests in the form of special-interest groups. So what I've come to say to our readers and readers everywhere is that I'm not saying that those groups are being served by special interest groups but they are serving for a different reason.""

What does the Carnegie analysis imply in terms of the way our system of government operates in America?

""The reason that we have our politics in Washington is because when it comes to government the people don't give themselves up until it comes to the issues that matter most to them and the right reason is national security.""

Does Carnegie's analysis suggest that Americans have a much better understanding of the motivations of power?

""No, people feel more satisfied with how things are going. And I think in many of our country's elections, there's a sense that people see the same thing.""

";"How does this document reﬂect the ""Forty-Millionaire Carnegie in his Great Double Role"" political cartoon?

As I've said before, the political cartoon is a fictionalized biography with no factual basis. The story doesn't contain any historical context or contextually significant events, but rather contains several brief scenes of an internecine struggle between the rulers of the country and those within the state. The only thing that keeps it from being a historical account of the great, political genius of Carnegie is the political caricature of his life that comes from his ""one-hundred-million-dollar-a-year"" operation in the early nineteenth century to push the British monarchs to support his plan to annex the Soviet Union from the USSR.

There are certainly few people who can identify with one of the three main stories in Robert Crumb's novel of the same name, which takes place more than 200 years after the founding of the United States and which also features two significant, but somewhat misunderstood, characters.

In the novel's first two parts, Crumb tells the story of the Great Carnegie, who in 1790 attempted to annex the Soviet Union from France in a bold attempt to make a grand bargain with the Soviet Union. As the novel illustrates, the situation there was more complicated than some of the other events of the Great Century. The Great Carnegie was not a leader of the free world, but only a rival.

";"How does the population growth in Detroit reﬂect the growth of the Auto Industry?

Detroit Motor City: Automobiles are still a dominant source of employment in this city – they account for the majority of Detroit's manufacturing employment. To reduce the auto industry's reliance on Detroit, this year only 13.7 percent of the automobile manufacturing capacity is needed to maintain a level of employment in this city, which is significantly lower than the figure at 29.7 percent, and is almost exactly what we would expect from a city of only 16 million people once its industrial jobs are gone. Automobile production in the city is about to rise again and will continue to generate $7 million in revenue each year from the new production.

How does the population growth in Detroit re·�ate the growth of the new manufacturing jobs in this city?

Detroit Auto Industry: If the Detroit factory that produces the automobiles and trucks comes back to life, Detroit Motor City will produce only about 11,000 vehicles per year. As a direct result, Detroit Motor City will have an employment rate of about 8 percent annually, which is roughly twice the national average.

";"How did labor change and stay the same from pre- Industrial Revolution to during the Industrial Revolution?

As labor became more efficient, the use of labour for industrial agriculture started to increase sharply, and so the use of labour for manufacturing changed so much that the production of agriculture was considered more efficient than that by many other workers.

Since the Industrial Revolution, in which the efficiency of the industrial production began to decrease, the use of labour for the industrial production by the majority began to increase.

As a result, in the early part of the Industrial Revolution, industrial farms became more efficient.

From the fall of the Iron Age, and the introduction of an artificial working day in the 19th century, mechanization was to begin. However, it would take several centuries for farming to recover its former levels with the advent of machines. This process would take several million years more for crops to have sufficient levels of fruit and vegetables and for fish to grow.

Industry in Europe, America, Japan and elsewhere has been the first to make use of the industrial and mechanized processes for growing crops without any work being done.

However, in China and Korea, production of agriculture has continued to decline, with all the products being used by small groups of people.

How many factories have been built since the Industrial Revolution?

Each industrial industry is connected in the production of all the agricultural products that are grown and processed.

14;"To what extent did labor beneﬁt from the Industrial Revolution?
";"To what extent did labor beneﬁt from the Industrial Revolution?

As labor became more and more important to industrial civilization, industrial agriculture began with the invention of hand tools. Once again, labor was an important ingredient in the production of agriculture. The industrial revolution also required labor to produce tools. After the Industrial Revolution, the production of tools became far more important.

The importance of labor as a component of the industrial revolution grew with both men and women. Men became richer and better able to provide food and labor for the needs of industrial communities. Women became less likely to be in labor, and they became more and more dependent upon men. In spite of the importance of labor to industrial civilization, labor does not always serve to supply products.

Hence, labor is often associated with certain behaviors that are associated with capital accumulation. Labor helps make the product more valuable to the consumer because labor reduces the price of labor, because it reduces the quality of labor, and because it increases the price of labor that produces an item.

One result of labor is that in the long run, labor helps create the production of consumer goods. At higher production levels, labor is a significant source of cost savings to the consumer because people who work more are much more productive. In this way, labor is also a source of economic growth.

";"To what extent did government interact with the economy?

The government has played an important part in building the foundations for our economy with our support, and those factors are what drive current problems such as high unemployment and high inflation. However, it did not control for many economic processes in place while doing so. For example, over the years we have witnessed the increase in government spending to boost the national budgets to match our demand rather than to satisfy the private sector.

In 2009 we introduced the FHA (Fiscal Responsibility and Reform Act - 2009 - a bill that requires all provinces to develop a plan and a budget to generate sufficient revenues to ensure the country is financially responsible for the health and well-being of its citizens). We also introduced the FEE (Federal Income Taxation in Fiscal Year 2009). We introduced numerous programs of interest to provinces and territories that are in need of capital and labour. Government also provided significant, but limited funding in areas that need it most. However, in the first instance, we are continuing strong and doing more to promote growth in these areas.

This is partly because we have a much richer and more prosperous business climate. Our industry, with all the capital necessary to support its expansion, has been much more productive over the years but our jobs are becoming more and more precarious.

“(Note that the original question was not about money, as this is part of a larger story about what William Jennings Bryan means by'money' here.)

What about this argument that Bryan doesn't speak in terms of free will or self-determination? In this same essay, he discusses how such a philosophy exists only in theory:

The idea that men and women are free to determine their own lives and lives; and, as an attempt at such a way of doing it, what I've come to call'self-deception', or, rather, 'the lie', is that the individual lives in this way but believes, to some degree, that one does something about that by doing so. To say that this way of doing it depends on people doing anything they can to avoid the idea that they have a right to do so because, in this sense, they don't, is to make us feel the moral pain of moral nihilism. In the course of this self-deception, there is a difference between those who believe in free will and those who believe in free will. The self-deception that people make about how they live according to their own free will requires us to treat those who believe in such a way as being essentially free in the same way.

You are probably telling me this isn't your place. The first thing to know is that people don't leave because they think, ""Oh my God, we lost them.""

American society has always been a struggle to change. As a country we have been pushed, under military occupation, to become more like France and Italy – a country with strong democracy. This has led to an endless economic collapse, and now we are running out of things to spend. And, most urgently, American society is trying to make sure that the next generation gets paid for their work. As this generation grows up, we need to remember we lost millions of our people to war and poverty. We want to help them be paid for their work, and we are making that abundantly clear to many in the rest of the world.

There are certainly other challenges. They may not seem serious to you, but our economy is in serious trouble. This year in France, France has more debt than it should be, as people are desperate to borrow as much as possible, and the government has put an end to even the idea of holding the economy hostage.

Some analysts and historians say that this debt is the biggest problem for Europe. They suggest that France is a country now in a different time. Why? Because the European Union failed to save the economy from financial collapse. It failed to save us from economic collapse and the world. It failed to save us from rising prices.

We are not being governed by government. We are being governed by individual citizens, not by those who have the power to set their own agenda, such as our founders. That's a responsibility we must take seriously.

I heard from several leaders—from the Democratic delegates in the Illinois Senate to Bernie Sanders himself and a number of former House members like Martin Heinrich—that the new House agenda would mean that the Democratic Party would move to the center and be governed by the superdelegates in the House of Representatives—thus shifting those of us who are from the Democratic Party in those places towards the progressive wing of the party.

I heard the story from a few of the members of South Carolina that you have—if the Democratic Party can change a majority of the House majority, if it can't change their vote in a majority of ways, then that will change that.

";"What potential problems can you identify in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory that may have contributed to the death of so many workers?

As you mention in that short video, I was in a large meeting with people who, in an attempt to determine some of the problems, would do a better job of answering my questions. I asked about many things, including safety issues, how many people that shirtwaist factory produced shirts.

I had a question about the idea of the shirtwaist factory becoming a manufacturing facility, and what they might do with it. It was not an easy one. It was the hardest one.

So I asked, ""Is this the solution anyone wanted?""

I could not explain how people can see and understand what my problem is, because it would take several months to get something done, and then somebody could say, ""You know who in this room is getting more and more anxious that this shirtwaist factory is going to start producing shirts when it's done?""

That is, even though it's going to become a manufacturing facility, the shirts could be more expensive, or in the long run, it's going to make people less of a factory worker.

So is that something the people need to talk about?

For one, I think some of us in this audience want to see more regulation. Maybe the government has to take action in the future. It would be nice to see the government take action."
