0;Christopher Columbus was;the first to discover America. Columbus' discovery, however, was not without controversy. Some Native Americans claimed that the Spaniards were cannibals and cannibals should be exterminated. The Spanish, on the other hand, argued that Columbus had made a discovery that would benefit the Spanish people by opening the way for trade and trade goods to be brought to the New World. In 1609, a group of Spanish explorers led by Diego Velasquez landed in what is now present-day Mexico, and began to colonize the region. They established a trading post at Tlatelolco (today's Chichen Itza) and built the first Spanish fort in the region, which was known as San Juan de Ulloa. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching!

1;William Penn was;"a slave. In 1838, the Supreme Court ruled that slavery was legal in the United States, a decision that would have a profound impact on the lives of African Americans for decades to come. But Penn's story is far from unique. According to data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau, there are more than 1.5 million slaves in the United States, a number that has remained steady since the Civil War. The vast majority of those slaves were born in the United States, and many of them came to the country as indentured servants. But while slavery was legal in the United States until 1838, it was not the only form of slavery that existed in the country. Slavery, as it was known at the time, was a system of labor and ownership of human beings that had its roots in the pre-Columbian Americas. The word ""slavery"" comes from the Latin word slave, meaning ""servant"" or ""slave"
2;Summarize why settlers came to Jamestown and Plymouth colony.;Explain the difference between colonial and settler governments. What was the role of the governor in colonial government? Describe the relationship between settlers and Native Americans. How did settlers deal with the Indian problem in New England, and why did they do so? What were the most important factors that led to the settlement of Jamestown and Plymouth? What were the reasons for the colonists' decision to settle in North America? What were the main problems that settlers faced when they arrived in the New World? What were the main causes of the American Revolution? What were the main causes of the Revolutionary War? What were the main causes of the Civil War? What were the main causes of the Great Depression? What were the main causes of World War II? What were the main causes of the Cold War? What were the main causes of 9/11?
3;What are the different ways in which early settlers in the English colonies developed new and unique forms of government?;A number of factors contributed to the development of a new form of government in the colonies, but one of the most important was the need to deal with the problems of poverty and social unrest that were common in the early days of colonial settlement. As we have seen, this was a time of economic and social upheaval, and it was not surprising that people were looking for ways to improve their lives and the lives of their families. In order to do this, they had to come up with a new system of government that would be responsive to the needs of the people, rather than the needs of the elite. The first step in this process was the formation of a government, which was called the Council of Colonies (1649-1660). This government had the power to make laws and regulate the affairs of the colony, but it was not an elected body. Instead, the Council of Colonies was made up of a number of representatives from the different towns and villages in the colony,
4;What role did religion play in the founding of English colonies?;"Religion played a major role in the founding of the United States of America. In 1607, John Winthrop, a Puritan from Massachusetts, wrote a letter to his son that laid out the principles of the colony he was about to set up. Winthrop believed that ""all men are created equal"" and that God was on his side. He wrote, ""I am of opinion that the most effectual means of securing this is to have a religion which is free from superstition, and that is the religion of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the world."" The first colony in the New World was named after Winthrop, and it would be his name that would be engraved on the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. What is the relationship between science and religion? Science is the study of the natural world around us. It can be used to understand our place in the universe and how we fit into it. The word ""scientist"
5;How did geography influence the way the English colonies developed?;Geography is a big part of it. We have this idea that the United States was a land of opportunity, and it was the English who came to colonize this land, and that's a myth. There was a lot of land that was uncolonized, and it was very, very hard to get to the west coast of North America. The Spanish were the first to do it, in 1520 or 1521, and they had no navigable river, so they had to go by land and sea. And that was a long, arduous journey that took a couple of years to get to New England. So, you know, the English colonies were very different from the French colonies in terms of geography, and they developed different ways of organizing themselves. The French had a much more centralized government, and they had a lot of people in the upper echelons of power, and they were able to use that as a basis for their political and economic
6;How many colonies were in New England in 1750?;The number of colonies is a matter of debate among historians. According to one estimate, there were about 1,000 colonies in the United States at the time of the Revolutionary War. In addition to Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, North Carolina, South Caro- lina, Virginia, and Georgia, there were several others that did not become part of the United States until later in the 19th century. These colonies included the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. The total number of colonies was estimated to be as high as 4,000, but this number has fluctuated over the years. For example, during the Civil War, some estimates put the number of colonies at as few as 1,000. Other estimates have been in the range of 2,000 to 5,000. What was the population of the colonies in 17
7;John Locke was;a man of the Enlightenment. He believed in reason, the separation of church and state, and a free market in which people were free to choose their own way of life without interference from the state. In 1776, the British Parliament passed the Bill of Rights, which enshrined the rights of the individual in the Constitution. Locke's ideas were the foundation of the American Revolution and the Declaration of Independence. Locke was an advocate of individual rights, but not in the way we think of them today. He did not want government to take away people's rights, but to protect them from being taken away by government. The idea of liberty is a good one, but it has its limits. Locke's view of liberty was based on the idea that we have the right to do what we want with our own bodies, but not to do what we want with other people's bodies. This is what makes him a libertarian. Libertarianism is the philosophy that
8;Stamp Act was;"a response to the ""vast majority"" of cases in which police failed to record the identity of suspects. It requires police to record the name, address, date of birth and sex of every person they arrest, as well as any information they obtain from the arrest, which is used in court. The law has been in place since 2006, but was extended to all state and local police forces in July last year. Police chiefs and the Home Office have said they are working to improve record-keeping, but critics say it is too little, too late. 'Troubling trend' Labour MP Keith Vaz, who chairs the all-party home affairs select committee, said: ""This is a worrying trend and one that needs to be addressed by the government.

9;Townshend Acts was;"the first to use the term ""socialism"" in its title. The Act of 1832 created the New York State Board of Education, which in 1833 became the first state-chartered school board in the United States. The Board of Regents of the University of New York (UNY) was created in 1834 to provide a university for the state and its citizens. The state of New York was one of the first to recognize women as full citizens and equal to men in civil rights, as well as a pioneer in the development of public education. New York's first female governor, Eliza R. Snow, was elected to the governorship in 1836. During the Civil War, New York became an important center of the Union Army and served as a staging area for the American Expeditionary Forces in the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In 1864, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, ending slavery in the United States"
10;Intolerable Acts was;"a series of short stories by Janny Wurts. Contents show] Publisher's summary Edit The year is 2145. Humanity has colonized the solar system, but there are no signs of life beyond a few planets and an asteroid belt that orbits the sun. In this time, a group of scientists, led by Dr. Robert Heinlein, discover a new form of life on a planet they call Terra. The discovery is hailed as a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life, but Heinlein's critics accuse him of plagiarizing his science fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land and the short story ""Trouble in Paradise"" to create a new genre of ""fantasy"" that is not science fiction at all. Plot summary Edit The story begins with a young woman named Jane who is about to graduate from high school and embark on a career in the entertainment industry. After her graduation, she goes to work as a production assistant on a"
11;George Washington was;"a slave. In 1820, the Supreme Court ruled that slavery was legal in the United States, a decision that would have a profound impact on the lives of African Americans for generations to come. But that decision was overturned in 1857 by the Dred Scott decision, which declared that the right to own a slave was a ""privilege, not a right."" Today, there are more than 1.2 million slaves in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The number of slaves is expected to rise to more than 2 million by 2060, and that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the slave trade. ""We have a lot of people out there who are not aware of this,"" Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said in a speech to the NAACP in 1963. ""It's time to get the word out that this is a crime against humanity."" The Slave Trade in the 19th Century"
12;Declaration of Independence was;"the first in a series of constitutional amendments to the U.S. Constitution. It established the United States as a republic, which is a form of government in which the people are sovereign and have the right to decide their own government, as well as how that government is run. In other words, the government is run by the people, not by the government. This is what we mean when we say ""democracy"" or ""republican government."" The Declaration of Independence states in Article 1, Section 8: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" These rights are protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of"
13;Which ways did the Great Awakening contribute to the independent spirit of American colonists?;I think it's fair to say that the most important factor was the Enlightenment, which gave us a sense of the world as it was and not as we wanted it to be. That was an important step in the development of the United States as a nation. But there were other factors as well. For one thing, we had a lot of people in the New World who were looking for something to believe in—that the world was going to be different from what it was before and that they had a right to be part of it. And they did, in large part, by forming religious communities and joining together to fight for their beliefs. What was the relationship between religion and political power in the United States? Religion played a very important role in the political life of the United States. In 1776, the Articles of Confederation were signed, and that created the basis for the Constitution of the United States. It was a very religious document, with references to God
14;What effect did the Glorious Revolution have on the American colonies?;It is difficult to say what effect the Glorious Revolution had on the American colonies. There are a number of theories that have been put forward by historians, but none of them are conclusive. One theory is that the Revolution was a turning point in American history, and that this is the reason why Americans are so angry with the British government and their government in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The other theory is that the British did not have the right to take over the American colonies, and that they were forced to do so by the French and the Americans. This theory is based on the fact that the French had a treaty with the Americans that guaranteed the independence of the American colonies, and that the Americans refused to ratify this treaty. In other words, the French and the Americans were in a position of power and influence in the American colonies, and this made them the aggressors. How many Americans were killed during the Revolutionary War? According to a survey conducted
15;Imagine you are a colonist in 1767, unhappy about Britain’s policies toward the colonies. Write a pamphlet explaining your position and urging other colonists to sup-port resistance efforts.;The pamphlet would be read by a group of colonists and the pamphleteer would be shot and killed in cold blood as a warning to others. This is what happened to George Rogers Clark, a British-born abolitionist who wrote The Abolition of Slavery in the United States (1834). In the 19th century, there were a number of attempts to assassinate British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, but none of these were successful. One reason may be that Disraeli was a strong supporter of the abolitionist cause and had no qualms about assassinating those who opposed his policies. Another reason may be that the British did not have the manpower to carry out an assassination on such a large scale. Finally, it is worth noting that, as noted above, British troops were in the field at the time of the assassination attempt, and they could have prevented it from taking place. The most famous assassination attempt on a British prime minister was in 1857,
16;Articles of Confederation was;"the first to use the term ""Confederate States of America"" in its title. The Articles of Confederation, a set of laws passed by the Continental Congress in 1777, established the United States of America as a federal republic, with each state having its own legislative, executive, and judicial branches. In order to avoid conflict with the British Crown, the Articles stipulated that the federal government would be composed of three branches: the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Supreme Court. The first two branches were created by the Articles, and the third was created by the U.S. Constitution. Article I, Section 8 of the Articles of Confederation states in part: The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States; but all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; and a"
17;Northwest Ordinance was;the first of its kind in the United States. It prohibited a woman from wearing pants in public, and required men to cover their heads when they walked down the street. The ordinance was repealed in 1887, but not before women were forced to leave their homes and work as maids, nannies for wealthy families, and housekeepers to pay for their husbands' health insurance. In the 1920s, a group of women led by Mary Wollstonecraft wrote The Age of Innocence, a book that argued for women's suffrage and the right to vote. They were denied the right to vote in the U.S. until 1920 and again in 1920 when the Supreme Court ruled in Reynolds v. Sims that women were not citizens of the United States. The Women's March on Washington is expected to draw thousands of marchers, but organizers are hoping the event will be a one-day event, rather than a multi-day march. Organizers

Contents show] Prelude Edit ""I have no idea what you're talking about."" ―Obi-Wan Kenobi [src] The Clone Wars began in 22 BBY, when Count Dooku, a Separatist general, launched an invasion of the Republic.[1] The Republic responded by sending a task force to destroy the droid army, which was composed of droids built by the Trade Federation and other corporations in order to gain access to the galaxy's resources and resources that were in the hands of the Republic. However, this force was unable to stop Dooku's invasion due to the Jedi Order's lack of knowledge of the droid army's capabilities and the fact that the Republic had no means of defending itself against the droid army's advanced weapons and tactics.[2] In response, the CIS began a"
19;Constitutional Convention was;the first of its kind in U.S. history. It took place in Philadelphia on the first Monday in July 1787 to discuss the constitution of the United States. What is the Constitution? The Constitution is a document that sets the rules for the government of the United States. It was written by the Founding Fathers and ratified by the states in 1787. This means there are two versions of the Constitution, one for the federal government and one for the states. Each state has its own set of rules for how they are going to run their government. For example, New York is a state of the United States, but the state constitution does not allow them to pass laws that conflict with federal law. In other words, New York's laws are different from those of other states. How do I get involved in the Constitutional Convention? You can sign up for the Convention by sending an email to delegates@constitution.org. This is a great way to
20;Great Compromise was;a very different beast to the one we had in the first game. It had to do with the amount of enemies in the game, which was more or less the same as in the first game, but there were a lot more of them. We wanted to make it a little more challenging, but at the same time not so much that it was a game of dodging and running around, but more of a game of taking out as many enemies as you can before they get to you. So that's the difference between the two games. The difficulty is a little bit more in Dark Souls 2, but not so much that you're going to have to play the game to the last boss in order to beat it. IGN: What was the inspiration for the game's music? Yoshida: I'm a big fan of classical music, so the music that we used in the opening and the ending was inspired by a lot of classical music. It's
21;Three-Fifths Compromise was;a compromise between the Republicans and Democrats. In order to pass the three-fifths compromise, both parties had to agree to some form of tax increase on the wealthiest Americans. This is the basis of the estate tax, which is levied on inheritances over $5.49 million. The tax has been in place since 1913, and it was designed to raise revenue for the government by reducing the amount of money that estates are able to pass to their heirs. However, since its inception, the estate tax has proven to be a highly regressive tax, as well as one that does little to help the middle class. According to the Tax Policy Center, the top 1 percent of income earners pay an average tax rate of 39.6 percent, while the bottom 50 percent of earners pay an average tax rate of just 12.3 percent. This disparity is due in large part to the fact that the wealthiest Americans have a lot of money, and are able to pass their wealth on
22;Federalists was;"the name of a political party founded in 1848 by William Tompkins. It advocated a strong central government, the abolition of slavery, and an end to the ""tender mercies"" of the Federalists, who were opposed to these ideas. The name was derived from the fact that Tompkins was a slaveholder and a member of the Whig Party. In the United States, there are two versions of the Constitution: the U.S. Constitution as it was adopted in 1787 and the U.S. Constitution as it was adopted in 1791. Both versions have the same text, but differ in how they are written. For example, the 1787 version states that the President is the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, while the 1791 version states that the President is the Chief Executive Officer of the federal government. History [ edit ] [2] and ""the most powerful man in the world"""
23;Antifederalists was;"the name of a political party that advocated the secession of the United States from the Union. In 1864, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) began to compile a list of anti-federalists, and the name was changed to the American Freedom Party (AFP). The AFP was founded in the summer of 1864 by William Jennings Bryan, a former slave-trader and abolitionist. Bryan had been elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1858 and served as vice president under Abraham Lincoln from 1861 to 1865. In his speech at the Republican National Convention in 1864, Bryan called for the ""abolition of slavery"" and said, ""I am a free man because I have renounced the negro race, and I do not intend to be any longer a slave."" Brazile's book describes the history of the AFP as follows: On the night of July 4, 1864, a mob of over 1,000 white"

25;How was the Constitution written as a flexible framework of government?;It was written to allow the people to govern themselves in a way that they saw fit. That's the way it was written. The framers were trying to get as close to that as they could without going off the rails. Why do you think people are so opposed to the government being involved in health care? I think it's a symptom of the fact that we have a lot of problems in this country, not just health care. The biggest problem we have is the lack of trust in government. People feel like their government is out to get them, and that's not good for our country. What's your take on the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision that opened the floodgates for super PACs to spend unlimited amounts of money in elections? That's an interesting question. There are two ways to look at it. One is that it's a decision that has the potential to undermine the First Amendment, which is one of the most important

27;Take on the role of a Federalist or an Antifederalist at a state ratifying convention. Write a speech in which you try to convince your audience to either accept or reject the new Constitution.;You can do this by speaking from the point of view of the people, or you can use your speech to argue for the ratification of the new Constitution. Either way, the goal is to make it clear that you are a Constitutionalist and not a Federalist. This is a great way to get people to think about the Constitution in a new way, and it can be done in a variety of ways. For example, you can: Speak from the point of view of the people and explain why the Constitution is the best way to govern the United States. Argue that there is no reason to change the Constitution, and that the people have a right to do so. Explain why the Federalist Party is better than the Democratic Party, and why the Democratic Party is the lesser of two evils. Write a speech that is designed to convince the people that the Constitution is good and should be ratified as soon as possible.
28;Francisco Pizarro was;"a member of the ""La Guardia Committee"" that drafted the U.S. invasion of Mexico in 1846. In the mid-1800s, Pizarro's brother-in-law, Antonio López de Santa Anna, became the first president of Mexico after the death of his father in 1848. Santa Anna had a close relationship with the United States, and the two countries fought a series of skirmishes over the next two decades. In 1856, a Mexican army under the command of Gen.

30;Explain how the fur trade contributed to the slow growth of New France.;What was the relationship between fur trading and the French Revolution? In 1789, France was in the throes of a civil war. The Jacobins, led by Louis XVI, wanted to abolish the monarchy and replace it with a republic. This was an attempt to bring France into the modern world by abolishing feudalism and creating a modern state. The French Revolution had its roots in the slave trade, which was a way of extracting wealth from the slaves and selling it to the rich. This led to the abolition of slavery in France and the rise of the working class. The fur trade helped to make this possible. Why do you think it was important to get rid of the fur trade? Fur trade was one of the most important factors in the French Revolution. It was used as a means of wealth extraction and the sale of slaves. The fur trade was the first step in the process of enslaving the French people. How did the fur
31;The king of Spain created a scheme to oversee his empire in America. What system did he use to govern the distant colonies?;A king was the head of a state, and the colonies were his subjects. He had no power over them except as a protector of their rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. They did not have the right to vote for a king, nor did they have the right to make him their king. In 1619, King Charles II of Great Britain, a man of the world, declared himself king of the English-speaking world. His claim to the throne was based on the fact that he was the son of William the Conqueror, who had conquered England in 1066. The British Empire stretched from the Atlantic seaboard to the Himalayas, and was the largest in the world at the time. Charles II was born in the town of Boulogne-sur-Mer, France, on March 3, 1536. His father, King Henry VIII, was an aristocrat and a devout Catholic. Henry VIII married Anne Bo
32;Why did the various groups of Spaniards come to North America?;In 1519, a group of about 100 Spaniards landed in what is now New York, and the Spanish were welcomed with open arms. They built a fort on Long Island to protect themselves from Native Americans, and in 1520, they began trading with the Native Americans. What was the relationship between the Spanish and the Native Americans? It was a mutual respect for each other, but there was no love lost between the two groups. The Spanish had a lot of land to work, and many of the Native Americans were landless, living on the fringes of the Spanish empire. They did not have the resources to fight for their independence, which is why they settled in the United States. Why did the Spanish decide to colonize the New World? The Spanish wanted to expand their empire to the Pacific, and they believed it was the best way to do that. It was a time of war, and Spain was in the throes of a
33;Were the French or Spanish colonies more successful? Why?;"In this episode we look at the history of the French and Spanish colonies in North America and what they did to make them successful. The first thing to note is that there is no such thing as a ""success"" in the history of any country. It is a matter of how you define success, which can be as simple as being able to produce a surplus or having the highest per capita income in a country. For example, the United States is the richest country in the world, but it does not qualify as a success because it has not produced a surplus in the past 100 years. In other words, we are talking about different kinds of success. So how did the French and Spanish colonies achieve success? What was their secret? First, let's start with the obvious: they built the roads and railroads that were essential to the success of the colonies. These were the most important means of transportation in the colonial era, and they were built"
34;How did the Catholic Church contribute to the Spanish settlement of the New Mexico territory?;It is difficult to say how much the Spanish contributed to the settlement of the New Mexico territory. However, we know that in 1521 a Spaniard named Diego de Alvarado came to the New Mexico territory with his wife and two children. The Alvarado family was one of the first to settle in what is now New Mexico. They had a ranch and lived on the land for several years before moving to the Rio Grande Valley, where they established a trading post. In 1523, the Alvarado family left the Rio Grande Valley and began to settle in the area now known as Santa Fe. What was the relationship between the Spanish and Native Americans at this time? The relationship between the Spanish and Native Americans was complicated. On one hand, the Spanish wanted to expand their territory and colonize the New Mexico territory. On the other hand, the Indians did not want to be part of Spanish expansion, and were willing to fight to the death for their land

38;Powhatan Confederacy was;"the name given to a confederacy of Native American tribes in what is now South Carolina. The Powhatan Confederacy had its origins in 1780 when British troops under the command of General William Howe arrived in the Carolinas to take control of the region. The British were looking for a way to expand their influence in the region and they decided to establish a colony of their own, which they called ""Powhatan"" in honor of the chief of the tribe, who was known as a war hero and the first governor of the colony. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website After several years of fighting, the British withdrew in 1783, leaving the colony to fend for itself. However, the colony continued to grow and by the end of the 19th century it had more than 1,000 members, including a number of prominent men in the South. In 1820, the United States declared war on Great Britain"
39;Explain how tobacco saved Jamestown.;The story of tobacco is a long one. It began in the 16th century when Europeans began to smoke the plant for medicinal purposes. By the mid-1700s, tobacco had become a staple of the English diet, and it was used to treat a variety of ailments, including coughs, bronchitis, rheumatism, gout, tooth acrimony (the pain caused by plaque in the gums), and the common cold. The use of tobacco as a cough suppressant was so widespread that in 1707, King George III issued a decree that anyone over the age of 16 was prohibited from inhaling tobacco, even in private. This was an attempt to protect the health of the young, who were at risk of lung disease from smoking. However, the ban did not apply to children, who were allowed to smoke as long as they were accompanied by an adult. Tobacco's role in the founding of the United States was even more dramatic
40;How did the enclosure movement change England’s society?;In the 19th century, enclosure was a way of life for a lot of people. It was an economic and social system in which people lived in enclosures, which were small, tightly-knit communities. The idea was that you could make a living by growing food for your family and then selling it to the people who lived in the enclosures. This was the basis of the agricultural revolution, which was based on a combination of farming and animal husbandry. What was the impact of enclosure on the English working class? Equestrian enclosures were very important in the development of the industrial labour movement in Great Britain. There were about 1,000 horse and mule teams in the early 1800s, and by the end of the 19th century they were the largest and most important working class trade union in the country. The horses were used to pull wagons, and the team members were paid by the number of horses they pulled. In 1834, a
41;What caused friction in the Maryland colony?;The colonists were in a state of war with Great Britain at the time, and there was no way to settle the colony without a peace treaty. In 1609, John Winthrop, the governor of Massachusetts, signed a treaty with the Dutch that ended the war, but not before the Dutch had taken a number of colonists to the New World. Winthrop's successor, Charles Plantagenet, had a different idea: he wanted to establish a colony in North America, and he sent a ship to England in 1610 to try to secure a trade agreement with the Dutch. But the ship was turned back at sea, and Plantagenet was forced to return empty-handed. What happened next? Plantagenet and his supporters decided to go on the offensive, and they set out to find a new trading partner. They began a series of expeditions that lasted more than a decade, and by 1612 they had landed in what is now Rhode Island, the
42;What factors contributed to the growing rivalry between Spain and England?;It was a long time ago, but I was in the stands at Old Trafford when they played the World Cup in 1966-67. The English had won the tournament the year before, and they were the favourites to win it again. But Spain, led by Luis Figo, came to the tournament with a new team, the Real Madrid team that would go on to win the European Cup in '67-68. Figo's goal was the turning point in the tournament, and it was one of the most memorable goals in football history. How much did it matter to England that their rival was from Spain? It was an important factor, but not the only one. There were other factors as well. For one thing, England had the best players in the world at that time, and they were playing in front of a huge crowd. For another, the two teams were very different in terms of style of play. Spain were a possession-based team, with

44;William Bradford was;a native of Scotland who came to the United States in 1820. His first book, A History of the State of New York, was published in 1831. His second book, An Account of the State of New York, was published in 1833. Bradford had an interest in the history of his native country, and in 1836 he began to write a history of the state in which he was the author. The first volume of his History of New York (1836) was the first book to be published in the United States by a non-European, and it is considered by many to be the most important work of its kind in the history of the United States. In 1837, Bradford published a second volume of his History of New York, which contained an account of the first year of the American Revolution and the events that led to the establishment of the United States of America. This second volume was entitled The American Revolution and the Rise of the United States

46;John Winthrop was;a slave owner. In 1820, the state of South Carolina passed a law prohibiting slavery in the state, which was the first of its kind in the United States. This law came into effect on January 1, 1821. In the years that followed, slavery was legal in most of the states in the South, except for a few that had passed anti-slavery laws in the previous decade. By the end of the 19th century, the South had become a slave-owning society, and many people of African descent were forced to live in the South as indentured servants. Slavery in the U.S. began to wane in the mid-1800s, but it continued to be a part of the American social fabric for a long time after that. Slavery was abolished in the District of Columbia in 1871, and in 1882, the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified by the states
47;Massachusetts Bay Company was;"the first to use the term ""coastal"" in reference to the area. In 1836, the Boston Tea Party began in Boston, and a year later, Massachusetts Bay Company began shipping tea to the United States. By the end of the 19th century, the company had grown to become the largest tea company in the world, with over 1,000 teas shipped every year. Today, there are more than 100 companies that produce tea in Massachusetts, including Boston Tea Company, Green Mountain Tea Company, and many others."
48;Great Migration was;a time of mass migration from the Middle East. It began in the mid-19th century and lasted until the end of World War II. The majority of the migrants were Jews fleeing persecution in their homelands, but there were also a number of non-Europeans, such as Armenians, Assyrians, Greeks, Bulgarians, Romanians, etc. In addition to the Jewish population, other groups were affected by the migration, including the Slavic and Balkan peoples, as well as the native populations of Central and Eastern Europe. Migration to the United States and other Western countries was facilitated by the opening of the transatlantic slave trade in the 18th century, which brought large numbers of African slaves to the New World. This led to the growth of the slave trade in the Americas and the spread of slavery throughout the world. During the 20th century, many European countries became the destination of the migrants, especially after World War II.
49;Roger Williams was;one of the most prolific writers of the 20th century. He wrote a total of 1,744 novels, short stories, poetry, and short nonfic, which are published in the Library of America's National Book Award-winning collection of American Short Stories (NBAFS). In addition to his work as a novelist, Williams was an award-winning playwright, screenwriter, and screenwriter-producer. He is the author of the screenplay for the television miniseries A Time to Kill, which won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar in 2004. His film credits include The Long Kiss Goodnight, The Manchurian Candidate, and American History X. Williams died of natural causes at his home in Los Angeles on June 21, 2016. He was 85 years old.
50;Anne Hutchinson was;"one of the most influential people in the United States. She wrote a book called ""The Woman's Bible,"" which argued that women were better at math and science than men and could do the same jobs as men. Hutchinson's views were controversial at the time, but they have become part of the fabric of American culture. In the 1950s and '60s, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down laws that required women to register for the draft and served as a model for the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s and '80s. ""I think it's a good thing,"" Hutchinson said of the law's repeal. ""We need to be able to get rid of things that are not in our best interest and not in people's best interest."" But she added, ""There are a lot of things that are going to have to be taken off the books, and that's what's happening right now."" The repeal of the """
51;Explain Why was John Winthrop concerned about the ideas of Roger Williams?;I think it's a good question. Roger Williams was a very important figure in the history of the United States, not just as a scientist but as a political figure. He had an enormous amount of influence on the founding of the United States and the way we think about our country and what it means to be American. And he was an American patriot and a great American. So I think there's a lot to be said for his ideas and the way they were put into practice. But I think the question is, why was John Winthrop concerned about them? And that's what this book is about. How much of your research was done in the library at Harvard? What were the most interesting things you found in the library? The library is a wonderful place to do research. It's full of books that are in a state of disrepair, but they're also full of things that have been written by people who were interested in the subject and have
52;How did Thomas Hooker’s beliefs promote the idea of separation of church and state?;"Hooker was a member of the Quiverfull movement, which holds that women should be allowed to ""choose"" whether or not to have children, and that this is a God-ordained right. In his book God's Plan for Women, for example, Hooker argues that God's plan for women is to become ""mothers of God's children"" (p. 4). He writes, ""It is the right of every woman to make her own choice as to the number of children she will bear and how many of them she will give birth to"" (p. 5). The Quiverfull movement has been around for a long time, but it gained prominence in the 1990s and early 2000s as a response to the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion in the United States. The Supreme Court ruled that states could not ban abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. This decision opened the door"
53;Comparing In what ways were the causes and effects of the Pequot War and King Philip’s War similar?;In the case of the Pequot War, we have a lot of evidence to support the idea that it was a war of conquest, not an attempt to settle a dispute. The colonists were trying to get their hands on the land and they did not have the resources to do it on their own. In the case of King Philip's War, there was no way for the colonists to defend themselves, so they had to rely on the British army and the Royal Navy for protection. What was the relationship between the two wars? Both wars were fought in the Northeast, which is the region that includes New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia—all of the eastern seaboard of the United States. The war in the Northeast lasted from 1609 to 1612 and the war in the West lasted from 1612 to 1614. In both cases, the British and the colonists were at war with each other and they fought for control of
54;Why did the Pilgrims feel it was necessary to create their own government?;"In 1620, the Puritans were at war with the Dutch, and their government was in disarray. One of the most important issues was who should be the head of the government. The English had a tradition of being able to choose their leaders, which was one reason they wanted to create their own government. But the Dutch were a different story. They believed that the people were sovereign and had the right to make their own leaders. What is the difference between democracy and republicanism? Democracy is a form of government in which the people decide what is best for them. In a republic, there is no elected government, and the government is made up of representatives elected by the people. The American Founding Fathers, like Thomas Jefferson, were very clear about this. In the Declaration of Independence, they wrote ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights"
55;Imagine you are a Pilgrim in Plymouth Colony. Write a letter to your friends in Europe describing your first few weeks in the new land.;"What would you say? The Pilgrim's Letter is an example of a ""pilgrim's note"" written by a person who had no idea what they were writing, but wanted to share their experiences with the world. In this case, the Pilgrim's Letter was written on May 14, 1620, and was addressed to John Winthrop, governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony. Winthrop was one of the most influential men in New England, and had a reputation for being a man of the people. He was the first governor to establish a colony in North America, and was instrumental in the founding of the Plymouth Colony in 1620. Pilgrim's Notes, on the other hand, are the work of a man who did not have the benefit of a great deal of education and was unable to read or write at the time of writing. These notes were written in the form of journal entries, and are filled with scribblings, notes, and other writing that"
56;English Civil War was;"the first of a series of civil wars to break out in the United States. Contents show] Background Edit After the death of Abraham Lincoln in 1865, his successor, Ulysses S. Grant, began to consolidate his power and control over the Union Army, which had been in disarray since the Civil War. In 1866, Grant was appointed commander of the newly formed Army of the Potomac, a division of the Union Army under the command of General George Meade.[1] Meade's plan was to create a ""Greater Union"" by defeating the Confederacy at Gettysburg and reuniting the North and South under one government. The Army of the Potomac was composed of three divisions: the 1st Cavalry, the 2nd Infantry, and the 3rd Artillery. The division commanded by Grant was known as the ""Cavalry Division"" and was the first to enter the battle on April 19, 1863, when it took part"
57;Maryland Toleration Act was;"a response to the ""war on drugs"" that began in the 1960s. The law allowed police to stop people for traffic violations, but they had to prove that the stop was based on probable cause, rather than the suspicion of criminal activity. In other words, the state was supposed to have a reasonable suspicion that a person was in possession of a controlled substance before they could search them. But that's not what happened, according to civil rights attorneys who filed a lawsuit against the state last year. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Baltimore, alleges that Maryland's law is unconstitutional because it violates the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh (D) has said his office will defend the law, which is set to take effect July 1. Frosh told The Huffington Post in an email that the attorney general ""does not agree with the opinion of the court and is reviewing the opinion in light of"
58;Restoration was;the first of a series of changes to the city's street lighting. It began in the 1970s with the installation of streetlights that were dimmed to save energy, but by the early 1980s, city officials were looking for ways to improve the lighting of the city's streets without adding to the energy bills of drivers. A study by the city's Department of Public Works found that the cost of lighting was $1.5 million a year, which would have cost an average family of four in Los Angeles a total of $1,500 a year. The city began to experiment with lighting in various ways, including dimming streetlights to save energy, but it was not until the 1990s that the city decided to go full-on retrofit the streetlights. In the first year of the program, more than 100,000 lights were retrofitted, according to the city. Since then, there have been several upgrades to the city's
59;James Oglethorpe was;"one of the most prolific writers of the 20th century. He wrote a total of 1,788 books, which is more than any other writer in history (except Shakespeare, whose total is 1,814). Oglethorpe died in the early 1960s and is buried in St Mary's Church, New York, with his wife and children. The book is based on a series of interviews with Oglethorpe and his biographer, the late Robert Caro. Caro's book, published in 2005, has been a bestseller and is considered the definitive biography of Oglethorpe. In the book, Oglethorpe talks about his childhood growing up in a working-class family in the South Bronx, where he learned to read and write at a young age. He says the experience helped him become a writer and that he had a ""sense of what it meant to be a writer"" as a child."
60;After the Restoration, why did the English government openly work to promote additional colonization in North America?;A number of factors played a role in the government's decision to expand the colonies, including economic and political pressures from the British government. For example, in 1763, a group of English merchants led by John Winthrop (the father of the Massachusetts Bay Colony) petitioned the British government for permission to colonize the New World. Winthrop's petition was granted, and the colony was named Massachusetts Bay, which is the name we use today. Another factor was the desire of the colonists to establish a trading post that would serve as a gateway to the Atlantic Ocean. This was an important goal, as trade between Europe and the Americas was a major source of revenue for the British government. By the mid-1700s, the British government was looking to increase its trade with the Americas, and a trade post was the best way to do so. A third factor was the British government's desire to gain control of the American colonies and their natural resources. This goal
61;How did the English Civil War affect the English colonies in America?;"It is difficult to say what the effects of the English Civil War were on the colonies, but one thing is certain: the colonists did not take kindly to being ruled by a foreign power. In 1640, for example, King Charles II of England issued a proclamation declaring that ""all men and women of the English nation are free and equal in the eyes of God and the laws of the land,"" and that he would no longer be subject to the authority of Parliament. This was followed by a series of rebellions, which were quickly quelled by the English Crown. What was the relationship between the English and American Colonies at the time of the American Revolution? The relationship between the two was complicated, to say the least. On the one hand, there was a common language, English, which was the lingua franca of the colonies. On the other hand, American colonists were a mixture of English and Native American tribes, and many of the English-spe"
62;What events led to Cromwell’s rise to power in England?;Cromwell was born in 1560 and grew up in Gloucestershire. His father, John Cromwell, was a well-to-do landowner and the son of an Anglican vicar. He had a reputation for being a shrewd and shrewd politician, and in 1564 he won the governorship of the East Anglian county of Kent, which was part of the Crown Dependency of Great Britain at the time. The following year, Cromwell married Anne Boleyn, the daughter of Henry VIII's second cousin, the earl of Huntingdon. They had three children, all of whom died young and were buried in the churchyard of St Mary Magdalene, a parish in London's Kensington Palace. After his marriage to Anne, Cromwell began to build a network of political connections that would make him a powerful figure in the Tudor court. He became one of the most powerful men in England by the time
63;Imagine that you have been hired by the proprietors of New Jersey to persuade settlers to come there. Write an editorial for a newspaper in England to convince people to settle in New Jersey.;What would you say? A. The first thing I would say is that it is a good thing to be a settler, and that we ought to do all we can to encourage the settlers to come. But I am not in favor of a law that would make it a crime for a man to sell his labor to another for a wage that he could live on if he wanted to. That is an unjust law, and I would oppose it. Q. Would you agree with the statement that there is no such thing as a free lunch? A. No, sir. The fact is that a man has the right to eat what he pleases, and that is the right of every man in the United States. If he does not like it, he can go to his country of origin and get his food there. But he cannot go to another country and take it from the people who have made it their own. Q. Do you think that

65;William Berkeley was;a professor of English at Harvard. The most famous of his works is The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which has been translated into more than a dozen languages and is the basis for a number of popular histories of the Middle Ages. In this book, Berkeley argues that the collapse of the Roman Empire was caused by a series of wars that took place in the fifth century A.D. between the Parthians (Persians) and the Sassanid Caliphs (Sikhs). These wars led to the fall of Rome, which was followed by centuries of civil war, famine, pestilence, and war. Berkeley's argument is simple: Rome had to lose its power to maintain itself because it was no longer able to fight its way out of a quagmire. The Romans, he argues convincingly, did not want to be ruled by a people who were too weak to defend themselves, and so they turned to other
66;Royal African Company was;"the first to use the term ""slave"" in reference to Africans. It's a term that has been used to dehumanize African-Americans for centuries, but the origins of the term are not well understood. In 1808, the New York Times reported that slaves were called ""slaves"" in the United States and that the term was ""in vogue among the slaveholders of the South."" But there is no evidence that slavery was common in the South until the Civil War, when it became a common practice to enslave freed slaves. Slavish behavior and slavery are closely related to each other and have a long history of cohabitation. The first slave ship to set sail from Africa was the Mayflower, which arrived in 1620. The Mayflower was a slave ship, but it did not have slaves on board. In fact, most of the passengers were free people who wanted to go to the New World. When the Pilgrims landed on"
67;Explain why South Carolina began producing indigo.;The answer is that it was a way to make money, and that's the reason we're in the state of South Carolina. How many of you have been to the Indigo Ballroom in New York City? If so, what was your experience like? I have been to the Indigo Ballroom a few times, but not in a long time. It's one of those places that you go when you're in the mood for a night out, and the music is great, but there's nothing to do after the show. It's kind of like a dive bar with a dance floor. What are you looking forward to the most about your trip to South Carolina? My favorite part of the trip will be getting to meet the people who live there. I'm excited to learn more about their lives and how they're making a living, and what's going on in their community. Do you have any advice for people planning to visit South
68;How did the geography of the Chesapeake region affect its economic development?;It's hard to say because we're in the middle of a lot of research right now. The most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the area has been growing at a rate of 2.5 percent per year since the 1950s, which is the fastest rate in the country. That growth has helped create a number of jobs, including those in the oil and gas industry that are in the region. What are the economic benefits of the Chesapeake region? There are a number of reasons why people choose to live in the Chesapeake region. One of the biggest is the quality of life that comes with being close to the ocean. You get to go fishing, kayaking, boating, fishing in the bay, and the water is clean and crystal clear. It's a place where you can live in a community that is friendly and has a lot of people who are looking for work and want to make a living. The other
69;How did the economies of the Chesapeake region and South Carolina differ?;A lot of people have a hard time thinking about the difference between an economy that is based on natural resources and one that is based on human labor. But there is a big difference, and it's one of the reasons why I'm a Republican and not a Democrat. In my home state of Virginia, we have a state budget that is $1.5 trillion, and the federal budget is $3.6 trillion. That's a difference of more than $100 billion a year in the state budget. So if you look at the economic impact of that, it dwarfs any difference that we have in the federal budget. The difference is that Virginia produces more than half of the nation's coal, and that's the most valuable resource in the United States. It's not a matter of if, but when we're going to run out of coal. And that's what's driving the energy policy of the Republican Party. What is your view of climate
70;How did the slave trade develop in the Americas?;It is difficult to pinpoint the origin of the slave trade, but scholars have proposed a number of theories. One of the most popular is that Africans were brought to the New World as indentured servants, and that their enslavement was a way to make money for their masters. In addition, some scholars argue that African-descended people may have had a hand in the development of the transoceanic voyages that brought the enslaved Africans to the New World. What is the relationship between slavery and the American Revolution? Slavery played a significant role in the American Revolution, but not the only one. Slavery was used as a tool to gain control over the people who lived in the colonies and in the United States. The British, for example, used slavery to subjugate Native Americans, and the French used it to colonize the Americas. In 1776, a group of French colonists led by Jean-Baptiste Lamarquie (1721-
71;Imagine you are a backcountry farmer in Virginia. Write a letter to your local newspaper describing how you feel about Sir William Berkeley and the policies he instituted.;"The letter will be read by a reporter who will ask: What is your opinion of this man? How do you feel about his policies? Now imagine that this reporter has a secret agenda: to find out what you think and how you feel about Sir William Berkeley. This is the kind of story that is happening in the United States right now. And it's a story that has nothing to do with climate change, but everything to do with power and the control of information. The Washington Post's David Ignatius, for example, wrote a piece last week about a ""fierce battle"" between the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group that lobbies for fossil fuel interests. In the article, Ignatius quotes an EPA official saying, ""We're going to have to fight this tooth and nail, or the public will lose trust in our ability to protect the environment."" The EPA official went"
72;Grand Banks was;one of the most beautiful places I've ever been. It's a beautiful place to go for a day or a weekend, but the beauty of the area is in the water and the people who live there. There are so many things to do and see in B.C. that you can't get anywhere else in the Lower Mainland. I'm a little sad that I won't be able to do any of those things, but at the same time, I'm excited about the future of this place. B.C. Premier Christy Clark has promised to spend $1 billion on infrastructure over the next 10 years, which is a lot of money for a place that's not a big city. What's your take on that? The money is going to be spent in a way that makes sense for the people of British Columbia. We have an infrastructure deficit, and that's something that needs to be addressed. It's not a
73;fall line was;the best in the league. But it's hard to argue with the results, which are in a league of their own when it comes to scoring chances, with the Red Bulls leading the league with a league-best 1.33 per game. They have the second-best goal differential (plus-2, thanks to an assist from Bradley Wright-Phillips) and are tied for second in shots on goal (4.3 per game). The biggest difference in terms of goals scored and conceded has been on the backline, where New York's depth has been a key to their success this season. In the past five games, the Red Bulls have allowed just one goal in 10 games, a run that started with a shutout of D.C. United on April 2 and has continued to the present day. That's not to say there's no depth at the back, of course. Chris Duvall has played every minute of the team's last five

76;How did Puritanism affect the development of New England society and government?;"In 1640, a group of Puritans led by William Blackstone published The Commentaries on the Laws of England, a treatise that laid out the principles of English law. Blackstone was a member of the Court of Common Pleas, a court of common law established in 1639 to adjudicate disputes between private parties. The Commentaries were the first legal treatise to use the word ""law"" in its title, and they set the stage for the English legal system that we know today. In the early seventeenth century, the court was divided into three courts: magistrates, justices of the peace, and juries. Each of these courts had its own set of rules and procedures, and the rules and procedures of each court were different from the rules and procedures of the other two courts. For example, magistrates were required to give notice of a trial within three days of the date of arraignment, and juries were required to return a verdict within ten"
77;How did the geography of the New England and Middle Colonies contribute to their economic development?;"A number of factors played a role in the success of the New England and Middle Colonies, including the following: 1. A high degree of land ownership and ownership of land was the foundation of the economy of the New England and Middle Colonies. In 1750, there were over 1,000 families in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which was one of the most densely populated colonies in the United States at the time. By 1775, this number had dropped to less than 200 families. The majority of the land was owned by a few families, and many families had no land at all to speak of. This led to a large number of small farms and the creation of the ""farm to table"" economy that would become the hallmark of the New England and Middle Colonies. 2. The population of the New England and Middle Colonies was relatively homogeneous in terms of race, religion, and social class. As a result, it was easy to find a community"

If one is able to discern these signs, one is said to have ""witnessed the Holy Spirit,"" and the person is said to have been ""blessed with the Holy Spirit.""

Belichick's plan was to get the Patriots to play a ""catch-up"" game in the AFC Championship Game by using their star players as decoys and running back LeGarrette Blount as a decoy to draw defenses offside. This was a brilliant plan, as it allowed Belichick to exploit the Patriots' inability to defend the pass and force them to rely on their running game to win the game. The Patriots won the game in a convincing fashion, defeating the Indianapolis Colts 24-10 and advancing to the Super Bowl.

85;How did Governor General Andros’s attempt to weaken colonial resolve increase colonists’ anger towards England?;A number of factors played a role in the British government's decision to take the colony to war. First, there was a sense of urgency that came from the fact that they were in the midst of a civil war in the United States. Second, colonial sentiment was at an all-time high, with many colonists feeling that their country had lost its way and needed to be re-invented. And third, the British government had no idea how to deal with this new situation. In other words, they did not have a plan for what to do with the colony, and they could not figure out how to do so without causing a great deal of trouble. This is the story of what went wrong, and how it led to the outbreak of the War of 1812. How did Britain respond to the war? British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger and his cabinet made a series of decisions that were intended to help the colonists, but they ended up doing the
86;How did the ideas of the philosopher John Locke contribute to revolutionary ideas in the American colonies?;Locke's ideas were a reaction to the Enlightenment, which had begun to take hold in England and the United Provinces of the British Empire (now the United States of America). Locke argued that human beings are born with a natural right to self-ownership, which is the right to be free from others' use of one's property without one's consent. This right can be exercised in two ways: (1) one can acquire property by the exercise of one's free will, or (2) one can be forced to give up one's property by force, such as by the threat of physical violence. In both cases, the property owner has the right to resist the use of his or her property by others and, if necessary, to use force to prevent others from doing so. Locke believed that these two forms of property ownership are necessary for the flourishing of a free society and that the government should be the agent of the first form of property ownership and the agent of
87;Why do you think colonial merchant shippers were angry about the Navigation Acts?;It's hard to say. I think they were angry because they felt the government was taking advantage of them, and that was a big part of it. But there were other reasons as well. The first was that it was an attempt to get around the Constitution, which says you can't tax a citizen without his consent. That's the basis of the First Amendment to the Constitution. So if you're going to tax somebody, you have to get his consent, and that was not going to happen in the United States. What was the reaction of the British government to the passage of the Navigation Acts? The British government had no problem with it at that time. They were very happy to have it, and they thought it was a good thing. But they were not happy about it for a long time after it was passed. It took a few years for them to get their heads around it, and then they started to see the problems that it was causing.

Cotton Mather, the daughter of a mill worker, began her career in 1885 as a seamstress at her father's mill in St. Louis, Missouri. In the 1890s, she moved to New York to work for an advertising agency, where she designed clothing for a variety of clients, including Louis Vuitton, Dior Homme, Chanel No. 5, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Cotton Mather died in 1904 at the age of 50, leaving behind a legacy of beautiful, timeless designs that would become the standard for the twentieth century.
90;Pennsylvania Dutch was;the most common of the three. A number of factors contributed to the popularity of Dutch, including the country's reputation as a place to escape the horrors of World War I and the Great Depression. In the 1920s, a wave of immigrants from the United Duchy of Prussia, which had been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire for more than a century, arrived in the U.S. with the goal of establishing a Dutch-speaking state. The state of Pennsylvania was one of the first to recognize the new state, and Dutch became the state's official language by the end of the 20th century. Other languages with strong roots in the U.S. include Spanish, Italian, German, Irish, Welsh, and Scottish Gaelic. The last two are spoken by fewer than 1 percent of the population, but they have a strong presence in the media and are used to great effect in television shows like Game of Thrones. 6. English is

95;Explain how the Enlightenment and the Great Awakening influenced the American colonies.;"What is the relationship between Buddhism and science? Buddhism is a religion of the East. Science is a religion of the West. The two can coexist in the same way that a man and a woman can be in the same room and have the same sex, but they are not the same person. Science has its own set of rules, which are different from the rules of religion. Buddhism does not have a set of rules for the human being, but for the Buddha, who is the highest form of human being. The Buddhist rules are based on the principle of non-duality, which means that there is no duality in the world. The Buddha taught that everything is one, and this is the basis of his teaching.

96;What factors and motivations drove immigration to the American colonies in the 1700s?;What was the impact of immigration on the population of the United States? How did immigrants contribute to the growth of the American economy and society? The Impact of Immigration on the Economy and Society Immigration is a major factor in the economic and social well-being of the United States. In a paper published in the Economic Journal, we show that immigrants have a positive impact on the U.S. economy and society by providing labor, capital, and other resources that are necessary for the development of the country as a whole. The paper is the first of its kind to use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), a nationally representative survey of young people that began in 1972. The NLSY has been conducted every two years since its inception, and its data allow us to examine the long-term impact of immigration on the U.S. economy and society. Our analysis focuses on two key questions: (1) how
97;Making Comparisons In what ways did enslaved Africans develop their own culture in the American colonies?;"A number of factors played a role in the development of African-American culture, including religious and cultural practices, as well as the economic and political circumstances of the time. For example, in 17th-century New England, slavery was a relatively new phenomenon, and many people did not know what it entailed or how it affected their lives. As a result, the slave-owning class had little to offer in terms of education, employment, or social status. In addition, there was a lack of access to the English language, which limited the ability of slaves to communicate with one another and their overseers. African-Americans, on the other hand, were well-educated and had access to English-language books and other cultural and educational materials. This was a major factor in helping to shape the culture of the enslaved people, and it is no coincidence that the term ""colonization"" was coined to describe this process. What was the relationship between slavery"

In that time, there was no church in your home, and you were forced to attend mass every Sunday in a church that was in disrepair and had no altar. What would you do? How would you live your life? The question is a good one for any Christian to ask, but it is especially relevant in the United States, where the majority of Christians are Protestant, and many of the most powerful institutions in the country are Protestant as well. As a result, there are a number of questions that Christians in the United States have to ask themselves when they come to terms with their faith and how it relates to their lives. These questions include: 1. Do I have a right to believe what I want? This is the most important question of all. If you do not feel that you have a right to believe what you want, then you have

Write a letter to your employer, asking for a job offer or other job-related information. This is a good way to get your resume out there, as well as your resume's cover letter, which should be tailored to the job you are applying for.

100;Albany Plan of Union was;"the first to recognize the right of the state to secede from the Union. On June 14, 1867, the General Assembly of New York passed a resolution declaring that ""the people of the State of New York have a right to form a State of their own, and are willing to do so,"" and that it was ""the duty of the Legislature of the State of New York to take such measures as may be necessary to carry into effect the provisions of this resolution."" This resolution was signed by a majority of the Assembly, and the state was admitted to the Union on July 1, 1867. In addition to the Declaration of Independence, there are several other documents that have been used to establish the idea of states' rights. One of the most famous is the U.S. Constitution, which was adopted in 1787. The Constitution states that ""Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts"
101;French and Indian War was;the first of its kind to take place. It was a battle of two nations against each other in an attempt to gain control of the sea and its resources. The British and French had been at war for a number of years and both sides were looking for a way to end the conflict once and for all. In 1812, Napoleon Bonaparte, the French commander in chief, decided to invade India and take over the British-ruled subcontinent. Napoleon's invasion of India began on the night of June 25, 1812. The first day of the invasion was spent in the jungles of the Himalayas and the second day was spent in the open plains of the Indian subcontinent. On both days, French troops fought their way through the jungle and crossed the mountains to reach the foothills of the Himalayas. After a few days of fighting, the French were able to capture a number of towns and fortresses along the way
102;Treaty of Paris was;signed in 1864. The treaty provided for the transfer of French territory to the United States, which would be divided into two parts, North and South America. On June 14, 1868, President Ulysses S. Grant signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which divided the land between the United States and Mexico. In the treaty, the United States agreed to cede all of Texas to Mexico in exchange for $1.5 million in gold, and a treaty stipulated that Texas would become a part of the United States within 100 years. After the Mexican Revolution of 1810, the U.S. government began to take a more active role in the affairs of Mexico. During this time, the United States established diplomatic relations with Mexico, and in 1821, the first American consulate was established in Mexico City. By the 1830s, the American presence in Mexico was growing, and a number of American citizens were serving as consuls in Mexico City
103;Quartering Act was;a major step in the right direction. But it's not enough to make up for the lack of transparency, which has been an ongoing problem for the past two decades. In the 1990s, for example, Congress failed to pass a law mandating that companies disclose payments to lobbyists, despite the fact that they were the most common form of campaign contributions in the United States. The result was a system in which companies could avoid disclosure by using shell companies, which are not required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This is not the first time that a company has tried to hide its influence on policymaking. Last year, the New York Times reported that ExxonMobil paid $1.2 million to a lobbying firm run by former White House adviser Karl Rove to lobby for a tax break for oil refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. The company's efforts were thwarted by an executive order from President George W. Bush that barred companies from spending money on lobbying unless

105;Why do you think the British were so willing to pass new taxes in the face of colonial opposition?;It's a question that has been asked for a long time in this country: What is the point of taxing the British if they won't pay for it? And I think there are two answers to that, one of which is that the British are a nation of tax cheats, and the other is that they have an economic model that is based on taxation without a tax base. In other words, they have a very high tax rate on the wealthy and a very low tax rate on the middle class, and that's the way it should be. But the fact is that it's not working for the British economy as a whole. What are the lessons for the United States of America? One of the most important lessons is that you need to be able to raise revenue without cutting spending. That's what happened in the 1930s and '40s, and it's going to happen again in the 21st century. If you look at the
106;How were the British able to move their troops up the steep cliffs near the city?;It was a combination of two factors. First, they had an air force that was capable of dropping bombs on the enemy from high altitudes. And second, British intelligence had learned that the Germans were planning to use a series of tunnels that ran under the city, and that these tunnels were used to move troops and materiel from one side of the city to the other. How did the British get so close to the German lines? There were a number of ways, but the most important was by sending a convoy of British and Commonwealth troops to the north of the city. This convoy was made up of two convoys, one going north and one going south. The British and Commonwealth troops were supposed to cross the Rhine at Breslau, which was in the middle of the city. But as soon as they crossed the river, they were attacked by the Germans. What was the Germans doing to the British troops? The Germans attacked the

109;Second Continental Congress was;a time of turmoil. In 1774, the Continental Congress voted to establish a government-in-exile in New York, which lasted until 1783. It was the first time in American history that a group of states seceded from the United States and formed their own government-in-exile. During the Revolutionary War, the British invaded North America and took control of much of the land north of the Appalachians. The American Colonies fought a war of independence against the British, but were defeated in the Battle of Saratoga in 1783. After the war, the United States became a republic, with each state having its own legislature and the right to decide its own policies.
110;Battle of Bunker Hill was;the first of a series of skirmishes that would lead to the Battle of Gettysburg. In 1864, the U.S. Army was in the throes of a Civil War-era reorganization, which saw it split into two armies, the North and the South. On April 19, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, abolishing slavery in the United States. This meant that slaves could no longer be forced into military service, a policy that had been in place since the end of the Civil War. The Thirteenth Amendment was ratified by the states on July 4, 1865. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching!

111;Government and Democracy After King George III refused to consider the Olive Branch Petition, in what ways did the Continental Congress begin to act like an independent government?;A number of factors contributed to the Congress' independence from King George III, but one of the most important was the formation of the Federalist Party (FDP), which advocated a strong central government, an end to state sovereignty, and the abolition of slavery. This is a key point to keep in mind when looking at the history of the FDP: the founding of the FDP was the first step in the process of creating a federal government that was independent of the British monarchy. As we have seen, the FDP did not take power in 1787, but it did have a significant impact on the political landscape of the United States. For example, in 1801, the FDP won the election to the U.S. House of Representatives, becoming the first party to do so since the Whirlpools in 1832. This was an important victory for the FDP, as it signaled the beginning of a long-term trend of party-switching in

But there were a number of things that came out of that committee, such as the Declaration of Independence, which was the first document in the United States to say that the colonies were independent of Great Britain. How did that committee of correspondence get its name? The committee had no name at the time, but it was called the Committee of Correspondence in 1776, after John Adams, who was the committee's chairman. He said, ""Let's call it the Committee of Correspondence because that's what we're going to do."" And that was the name that we have today. What was the committee's relationship to the British government? The committee was a very close-knit group of people, and they worked very closely together. They"
113;Imagine that you were a participant in the Boston Tea Party. Write a diary entry describing the event.;What would you say in your diary? I think it would be interesting to see what people think of this diary as a historical document. I'm hoping that the history of the Boston Tea Party will be told in a way that makes it clear that there was a lot of anger and a lot of anger that was directed at the British government, but it was also about people trying to figure out how to get their voices heard and what they could do to make a difference. How do you think history will look in 20 years? I think we're going to have a lot more people writing diaries and taking photos of their tea party, and that's going to help tell the story of what happened that day. It's not going to be the same as it was in 1773, but it's going to be more of a reflection of the world at that time.
114;William Howe was;"a member of the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). He had an animal cruelty conviction for beating a dog to death with a baseball bat in the 1970s and a civil case against the SPCA for mistreating his dog, which was euthanized after the animal cruelty conviction was overturned on appeal in the early 1990s. In his interview with WNYC, Howe said, ""I'm a dog lover and an animal lover, but it's hard to be in the middle of a war and have your life in danger. You can't go to the grocery store without being worried about what's going to happen to your dog or your cat."" The interview was recorded on June 1, 2015."
115;Nathan Hale was;"one of the most prolific writers of the 20th century. He wrote a book every two weeks for more than a decade, and his books were read by millions of people around the world (and in the United States, at least). Hale died in 2005 at the age of 90 after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease. In his lifetime, he wrote more than 2,000 books, most of them nonfiction. The following is a list of Hale's most famous books, along with their cover art. A Tale of Two Cities by Mark Twain This book has the distinction of being the first book to be published in the United States by a self-publishing company. The cover of Twain's A Tale of Two Cities is a picture of Twain's wife Edith sitting on a bench in the middle of New York City, surrounded by a sea of people. The text reads: ""I have seen the city and it is a wonder to me that any man"
116;Valley Forge was;a place of wonder. It was an oasis in the desert, where the sand dunes rose like a sea of green and the air was filled with the scent of flowers. There were no roads, no people to speak of, and no sign of civilization beyond the desert's edge. But that was the beauty of it. The desert was a blank canvas to create your own world, and you could do whatever you wanted with it. The people of Valley Forge were nomadic, living off the land as much as they could and making their own tools and toolsmithing to keep themselves alive. They had a reputation for being hard workers, and their skills were passed down from generation to generation. The most famous craftsman was the man who invented the bow and arrow. His name was Hyrkoon, and he was the father of the valley's culture. Hyrkoon lived in the middle of the desert, far from civilization and the rest
117;Marquis de Lafayette was;"a slave. In 1803, the United States Supreme Court ruled that slavery was legal in the District of Columbia, which is the nation's capital. This decision was based on the D.C. Constitution, which states that ""no person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due."" However, as we know from the history of slavery in the United States, there are a number of exceptions to this rule. For example, slaves could be brought to the U.S. as part of a marriage, and the slave owner had the right to keep them in the home for as long as he or she wanted. This is known as indentured servitude, and it has been a legal practice for more than 200 years. The"

119;John Paul Jones was;a member of the U.S. Navy from 1881-1914. He served as a ship's surgeon on the steamship Lexington (BB-56), which was sunk by a Japanese submarine off the coast of New York on April 9, 1941. The Navy Medal of Honor is the nation's highest award for valor in the line of duty. It is awarded posthumously by the Secretary of the Navy to a person who has distinguished himself or herself by gallantry above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a member of the United States Armed Forces. The Navy Medal of Honor has been awarded to more than 1,000 service members and civilian personnel since its inception in 1917. For more information about the Navy Medal of Honor, visit http://www.navy.mil/memorial/medalhonor.htm.
120;Charles Cornwallis was;a member of the Royal Navy. In 1775, Cornwallis was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in North America, which would become the United States of America (USA). Cornwallis' career was cut short by the Revolutionary War, but he continued to serve his country in various capacities until his death in 1826. The following is a list of his most notable achievements: The Battle of Saratoga in 1777, which led to the victory of the British forces at Long Island, New York. The Siege of New York and the surrender of George Washington, the President of the United States, on April 19, 1783. A major part of the American Revolution, in which British forces were defeated and the American Revolution took place. The War of 1812, a series of battles between the United States and Great Britain in the American Colonies. The American Civil War, which lasted from
121;Battle of Kings Mountain was;a series of skirmishes between the Free Marches and the Crowned Stag. Contents show] Background Edit In 1325 AE, King Harald Hardrada of Rovagug was forced to flee his capital after a siege of his castle was repelled by the Knights of the Round Table. He sought refuge in the lands of the Free Marches, which were under the rule of his brother Sigismund, and his forces began an invasion of the Crowned Stag in order to take it for himself.[1] The Battle of Kings Mountain took place on the night of the 23rd of August 1325 AE, during the Siege of the Castle of Kings Mountain. Sigismund had gathered a force of over 1,000 men and led them to the castle, where they fought their way into the inner sanctum of the castle. After a fierce battle, the castle was taken, and Sigismund was crowned King of the Free Mar
122;Why were the French at first reluctant to sign an alliance with the colonies?;It was a matter of prestige. They wanted to be the first in the world to establish a free trade zone with the United States, and the French had no intention of doing that until they had achieved that goal. What was the reaction of the British to the signing of the treaty? The British, of course, were delighted, but not at the same time. There was a lot of talk about how this was going to help them win the war in North America, and that was the most important thing to them. But it was not a good time for the British to be making a deal with the French. Why was that? The war was going badly, and the British were in a state of war with France for the first time in their history. They were very nervous about what would happen if they did this and it turned out to be a bad deal. Did you have any idea that the treaty would be such a disaster?
123;How did European countries aid the Americans in the war for independence?;It was a matter of economic aid, which in those days was the most important thing for a country to do. The British and French were the biggest exporters of cotton, and they had a lot of cotton in the United States. So they sent money to the U.S. to buy cotton and other things that were in short supply in Europe. What was the relationship between the two countries at that time? There was a very close relationship between the two countries, but not as close as it is today. The relationship was more or less that of a brother and sister. They were very close in terms of trade, but not so close that they would go to war over each other's business or anything like that. Why did you decide to write this book? I was in my 20s and working as a newspaper reporter in New York when World War I broke out in 1914. My father was an American, and my mother was German.
124;How has the artist portrayed the condition of Washington’s army?;I think it's a combination of the military being in disarray and the lack of a political leadership to take care of the military. The president's not doing a good job of that, and the military has a lot of issues that need to be addressed. What are some of the most memorable scenes in the film? One of the most memorable scenes is the scene where they go to the White House and there's a lot of blood on the floor, and the president is trying to put his hand over his face and it's very disturbing to see how much blood there is. It's a very sad scene, and I think people will be surprised by the level of violence that's going on in the film. How did you come up with the idea for this film? My friend and I were talking about how Washington, D.C., is the capital of the United States, and we wanted to make a film that looked at the city from
125;Imagine that you are a colonist during the Revolutionary War. Write a letter to convince European nations to support the Americans in the war.;The letter should be short and to the point: Dear Sir or Madam, Yours in Colonization, I am a native of the United States of America and have been for many years engaged in the colonization of this country. In 1776 I sailed from New York with a cargo of corn, which was the first of its kind to be brought to the West Indies by the British East India Company. Since that time I have labored to bring the same cargo to the shores of the American continent, and I am now at the head of a colony of about one hundred and fifty men, women and children, who are the first settlers of what is now known as the United States of America. The country is rich in natural resources, and has a large population of industrious and hard-working people. It is situated on the Atlantic seaboard of North America, and is in the middle of a vast tract of country, stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Rocky
126;Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union was;"the most popular of the articles. In 1832, the Constitution of the United States of America was adopted by the States and submitted to the people for ratification. This was the first time in the history of the United States that there was a written Constitution of the United States. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution states: ""The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States; but all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States, and shall not exceed the limit of the money that may be raised by the enumeration in the Constitution, nor any proportion which the Congress may think proper to give to the several states, under the authority of this section."" The Articles of Confederation, as well as the Articles of Confederation with Great Britain, are based on the idea that the people of each state have"
127;Northwest Ordinance,Shays’s Rebellion was;a series of revolts in 1810-1811 by Native Americans against the U.S. government. Contents show] History Edit The Northwest Ordinance,Shays’s Rebellion was a series of revolts in 1810-1811 by Native Americans against the U.S. government. In addition to the rebellion, there were a number of skirmishes between the United States and Native Americans that resulted in the deaths of many soldiers and civilians.[1] Background Edit On April 15, 1810, President James Madison signed the Northwest Ordinance into law, which declared that the federal government would no longer be in charge of Indian affairs and gave the states the right to govern themselves as they saw fit without federal interference. The Northwest Ordinance was one of the most controversial pieces of legislation of the 19th century, and many Americans were opposed to it on the grounds that it was an attack on the sovereignty of the states, a violation of
128;Describe the conditions that led to Shays’s Rebellion.;A lot of people were trying to get the land to sell, which is why there was a lot of fighting. It was the same thing in South Carolina, too. The South Carolinians had a lot of land that was worth a lot of money to white people, and they wanted to sell it to the blacks. So they started fighting over it. How did you come to be a part of the Civil Rights movement? I grew up in a family that was very anti-communist. My father was a professor of political science at the University of South Carolina at Beaufort, and he taught me about the history of the United States, and how it was a slave-owning country until 1808, when the Constitution was ratified. So we were taught that slavery was the worst thing that ever happened to the United States. I went to college and got a master's degree in American history, and that was my introduction to the civil rights movement
129;What do you think was the most serious flaw of the Articles of Confederation? Why do you think so?;"A few years ago I was in a discussion with a professor of political science at an Ivy League university. The professor asked, ""What is the most serious flaw of the Articles of Confederation?"" I replied, ""It's a failure to take into account the people who live in the United States of America."" He looked at me like I was crazy for saying that. But I was right. The Articles of Confederation were designed to serve the interests of the central government, not the people of the United States. In other words, the people of the United States have no say in who governs them. They are not allowed to vote for their own representatives in Congress and the president, even though they pay taxes to support those representatives. And if they do vote for their own representatives, they get nothing in return for their votes. So why do we have a federal government at all? It's because the people of the United States wanted it that way. They were willing to give"
130;How are the issues faced by the federal government today similar to those that were faced by the Confederation Congress?;I think it's a good question. The Federalist Papers and the Federalist No. 1 were written in 1787-88, and they dealt with the question of how to govern a nation that had grown to be the largest in the world at that time. The Constitution was a compromise between the British and the French, and that was an important part of the Constitution. It was the first time that the United States had a constitution that did not come from the top down, but from the bottom up. What is your take on the role of the Supreme Court in today's world? The Supreme Court is one of the most important institutions in the federal government. They make or break a lot of laws, and they have a lot of power. They can decide what is constitutional and what is not. They can decide whether or not the Constitution is the law of the land, and that's a very important role for the Supreme Court. How would you describe
131;Take on the role of a journalist during the time of the Confederation Congress. Write an editorial expressing your opinion of Shays’s Rebellion, and suggest how the government might handle such situations better in the future.;This is a game for 2-4 players that takes place in 18th-century New York City. Players take on the role of newspaper editors, reporters, and other members of the press who have a hand in the events that take place during the Shays’ Rebellion. Each player is dealt a hand of cards that represent the news that is being reported, and must decide what to write about, how to cover it, and who to talk to about it. The goal is to get the most accurate and up-to-date information to the public as quickly as possible, while avoiding being caught in the crossfire of political and social conflicts. This game is suitable for ages 10 and up. The rules are available in English and Spanish, and can be played with or without dice. For more information about the game, check out the Rules page. You can also download a print and play version of the rulebook here. If you have any questions, feel
132;Virginia Plan was;"a ""bureaucratic nightmare."" In the end, it was the state of Texas that got the ball rolling on this new, state-of-the-art facility, which will serve as the home of the Longhorns football program for the next 20 years. Texas Gov. Rick Perry signed the $3.8 billion, 25-year contract with the University of Texas last week in an effort to make Texas a national power in college football by the end of the decade. But there's one problem with the plan: It's going to cost a lot of money. According to the Associated Press, the state is on track to spend more than $100 million on the stadium, including a portion of the state's share of construction costs. That's not a small sum, especially when you consider that the Texas A&M Aggies, the state's most popular team, play in Kyle Field, a stadium that seats more than 60,000. ""I"
133;New Jersey Plan was;"a ""bipartisan effort to provide relief to New Jersey residents who have suffered and continue to suffer from Hurricane Sandy,"" according to a statement. It's unclear how many people in the Garden State are eligible for the relief, but Gov. Chris Christie (R) has been working with FEMA to help those affected by the storm. Christie's spokesman Kevin Roberts told The Huffington Post on Wednesday that the governor is ""committed to ensuring that every New Jersey resident is treated fairly and with dignity, and we will continue to do everything we can to make that happen."" In addition to the $5 million in federal funds, the state will provide up to $10 million in private donations, as well as an additional $5 million from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) to pay for damage to the George Washington Bridge in Lower Manhattan that shut down for more than a week last month. ""This is a great day for New Jersey"
134;Were the delegates to the Constitutional Convention representative of the American public? Why or why not?;"I have no answer to these questions because they are beyond my knowledge, and the question of what was the ""representative"" body of the American people in 1787 is a moot point. But it is worth noting that the Constitution did not contain a provision for an election of delegates to the Constitutional Convention, nor did it specify who would be the delegates from each state. In other words, there was no way to know who was going to be on the convention's ""list"" of delegates until it was time to vote on the Convention's agenda. What we do know is that, according to a letter written by James Madison on July 2, 1787, he was ""inclined to think it would be better for the United States to have a number of delegates from each State than one or two from each of the several States."" This was a view shared by many of the Founding Fathers, including Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, and George Washington"
135;Do you think the Founders were right in making the amendment process difficult? Why or why not?;A lot of people have a hard time understanding the Constitution because it's so complex. I'm a firm believer that the Founding Fathers did a good job of writing a constitution that would be easy to understand, but that's not to say that it was perfect. There were a lot of things that needed to be worked out in the first 100 years of the republic, and they were working on those issues at the time. But the fact that we have an Article V convention in 1787 is a testament to the power of the people to change the Constitution and make it work for them. What's your take on the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which allows corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections without disclosing who is paying for it? Do you think this is a good thing or a bad thing? I think it's a good thing for the American people to have a voice in the political process. The problem is that corporations are people, and they have the
136;Why did the delegates choose to conduct the convention behind closed doors?;It's a question that has vexed delegates for a long time, and the answer is that they did so in order to avoid the kind of chaos that would have occurred if the convention had been open to the public. In the case of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, that meant a public address by Bernie Sanders, followed by a roll call vote on the platform that was held in the back of the convention hall. This was the first time in the history of the Democratic Party that a presidential candidate had been allowed to speak to the convention without the approval of the party leadership. And it was an unprecedented move for an independent candidate who had no chance of winning the nomination. Why did the DNC choose to conduct the convention behind closed doors? There are two reasons for this: first, the rules of the Democratic Party are set by the Democratic National Committee, which is controlled by Hillary Clinton's campaign. Second, and more importantly, Clinton is the party's presumptive
137;Take on the role of an observer at the Constitutional Convention. Write a journal entry describing what you witnessed.;The following is a list of things to keep in mind when you enter the Convention: Be prepared to take a number of photographs and video recordings of the Convention, as well as other events that took place during the Convention. These will be invaluable for historians and historians of the United States to learn from. You will need a camera with a wide-angle lens to take the best photos and video. If you are unable to purchase a camera, there are a number of inexpensive cameras that are suitable for this purpose. The Convention was held in Philadelphia, and many of the delegates wore clothing that was made to fit the size of their body. This is a good way to get a sense of what it was like to be a delegate and a member of the Convention. The Constitution was written by a committee of the states, and each state had a representative to represent them in the Convention. The committee was composed of men of different political persuasions, and they worked in a collegial manner
138;John Hancock was;"a member of the New York Society of Freemasons. Hancock's brother-in-law, William Tompkins, was a Freemason as well. In 1837, Tompkins wrote a letter to the Grand Lodge of New York in which he claimed to have received a ""certificate of the Masonic Lodge of St. John the Baptist"" and ""an authentic copy of the Book of Common Prayer of the United Brethren of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry."" The book was written in the 17th century, and it contains the words ""We are one, we are many, we are the sons of the same God"" and ""All is One, all is One."" In his book A History of Masonry, historian and Freemason David Pritchard writes that ""the Masonic Order was the first to recognize the unity of the human race and the necessity of a common language, which is the foundation of the world's religions.""

139;Patrick Henry was;one of the most prolific receivers in NFL history. He caught 1,723 passes for 14,844 yards and 93 touchdowns in his 14-year career, which ended in 2000. The Hall of Famer is a three-time Pro Bowler and won a Super Bowl with the New England Patriots in 2000. Henry, who played his final season in the National Football League after being selected in the first round (11th overall) of the 1998 NFL Draft, died at his home in Los Angeles on Sunday, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. He was 65. Henry had a career-high 688 receiving yards in a Week 2 win over the Arizona Cardinals on Oct. 9, 2000. He had a career-high six touchdown catches that day, including a 52-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter to tie the game at 14-14. Henry's numbers were good enough to earn him the honor of being inducted into the Pro Football

The names are taken from the Congressional Record, which is available on the Library of Congress website (accessed March 2, 2017). Note: Some of the people listed are no longer in Congress, but have continued to speak out on the Constitution and its ratification. For example, Rep.

142;Government and Democracy Do you think it was important for all the states to ratify the Constitution? Why or why not?;"No, I think it was a good idea for the states to get on board with the Constitution. I'm not a fan of the Articles of Confederation, which were written by a bunch of people who had no idea what they were doing. The idea was that you had a federal government, but it was supposed to be the same as the state governments. It was a very, very bad idea. What do you think is the most important thing to keep in mind when reading the Constitution? That's a tough one. There are a lot of things that are in there that have nothing to do with government at all. The first thing that comes to mind is freedom of speech, which is one of the most important things in the Constitution. It says ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"" and that's a pretty important thing. Do you think the Founding Fathers were right in their belief that government is necessary"
143;How did the Federalists attempt to assure ratification of the Constitution ?;"How did the Federalists attempt to assure ratification of the Constitution?

A number of factors played a role in the success of the Federalists, but one of the most important was the fact that they were able to present a vision of the future that was consistent with the principles of republican government. This vision was based on the idea that government should be limited to the enumerated powers of the Constitution, and that the people had a right to alter or abolish it at any time by a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress. In other words, the framers of the Constitution did not intend for the government to be a one-man show that was run by a single, omnipotent leader.

What is the difference between a republic and a democracy?

Democracies are a form of government in which the majority of the people, rather than a small group of elites, decide what laws to pass and how those laws are to be enforced. In a democracy, there is no separation of powers, which means that the executive and legislative"
144;Why was New Hampshire’s ratification of the Constitution important?;"It was a key step in the formation of the United States of America. New Hampshire's ratification gave the people of the thirteen colonies an opportunity to make their voices heard in the ratification process, and in doing so, they were able to ensure that the Constitution was the product of the people, not the other way around. What is the relationship between the Constitution and the Bill of Rights? The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."" This is one of the most important provisions of the Bill of Rights, and it has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to protect the freedom of religion, speech, and the press from government encroachment. How important is the Constitution to the American"
145;Tariff of 1789 was;"the first to include a ""duty to pay"" to the U.S. government. In 1815, the United States became the first country to issue a currency backed by gold, which is why we have the dollar today. As a result of this gold standard, inflation was very low, and people felt better about their money than they had in years past. This led to a boom in the stock market, which helped the economy grow. However, the boom did not last, and by the end of the 19th century, there was a growing sense of unease about the stability of the dollar. Inflation and Deflation During this time, many countries around the world began devaluing their currencies to try to get a leg up on the U.S. dollar. The result was an increase in inflation in the United States and other countries. Inflation is defined as a change in the price of goods and services that is greater"
146;Bank of the United States was;"the first to recognize the need for a central bank. In 1867, the Bank of the United States was created as a private bank in New York City. It was the first bank in the United States to issue notes and redeem them for gold, silver, and other commodities. The Federal Reserve System (FRS) was created in 1913 to serve as the nation's central bank. What is the difference between a bank and a corporation? A bank is a business owned by one or more individuals, and has the power to make loans and accept deposits. Corporations, on the other hand, are private businesses that do not have a central bank or any government-issued currency. The term ""corporation"" is used to distinguish them from other types of businesses such as real estate, manufacturing, and trade. Who is in charge of the Federal Reserve System? The Federal Reserve System is made up of a board of directors appointed by the president of"

149;What precedent did George Washington set as president of the United States?;He was the first president to have a military, which is a different thing than a civilian government. The military has been in existence since 1789, and that's what we have today. It's not that there's a lack of civilian control over the military, but there is a lack of civilian control over the military as a whole. How do you explain the rise of Donald Trump, who has called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States? I think the answer is pretty simple. He's a demagogue, and that's what demagogues do. They make people feel that they're under attack, and they want to be the one who takes the fight to the enemy. That's what demagogues do. What's your take on the Trump administration's relationship with Russia? The relationship between the two countries is a complicated one. We have a lot of intelligence that Russia is trying to meddle in our elections, and that
150;Why did Hamilton think it was important to pay the national debt, the domestic debt, and the state debts?;I have no idea what Hamilton was thinking when he wrote the Federalist Papers, but it seems to me that he was thinking about the national debt as a way to pay for the domestic debt. If you look at the history of the United States, there are a lot of states that have been borrowing money from the federal government and paying it back in the form of interest on the national debt. And that's the way it's supposed to work. The state and local governments are supposed to make up the difference, and they do, in some cases. But in the case of Hamilton's time, the federal government was the one that was borrowing the money, and it was doing so at a rate that was much higher than the rate at which the states were making up the difference. What's your take on the argument that Hamilton wanted to avoid a repeat of the Civil War and instead focus on a peaceful transition of power to the states? Well, that's a good
151;Imagine you are James Madison. Write a speech explaining why you are against Alexander Hamilton’s financial program.;The Federal Reserve is a central bank that prints money to finance government spending. In order to do this, the Fed has to borrow from the government at interest, which is a form of taxation. This creates a debt trap, where the government borrows money and uses it to pay interest on that debt. The interest payments add up to more than the debt itself, and the debt keeps growing. Eventually, the government runs out of money, and has to raise taxes to pay the interest on the debt. Madison argues that a government that is debt-free is better than a government that is debt-crowded. If there is no debt, there is no need for government spending, and government spending does not lead to inflation. But what happens when you start taxing people for the privilege of being taxed? Taxes are an important source of revenue for the government, but they also have a negative impact on the economy. Taxes make people work harder, which means less money
152;Jay’s Treaty was;the first of its kind to provide a legal basis for the use of nuclear weapons. In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States and Soviet Union conducted a series of tests of thermonuclear weapons, which could be detonated over the Pacific Ocean or on the East Coast of the United States. These tests were aimed at determining the effects of a thermonuclear warhead detonating in the atmosphere and on the ground, as well as to develop a more accurate understanding of the physics of thermonuclear weapons. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in an arms race in which each side sought to develop the most powerful weapons and weapons systems in the shortest time possible. This competition led to the development of the hydrogen bomb, the first weapon capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to a target. After the end of the Cold War, there was a period of uncertainty about the future of nuclear weapons. In the early 1990s, President Bill Clinton
153;Pinckney’s Treaty was;the first of its kind to provide a legal basis for the U.S. to take military action against North Korea. It was signed in the wake of the Korean War, which ended in 1953.
154;Washington’s Farewell Address was;"a ""fairy tale of the American heart,"" according to The New York Times. In the years since, Trump has continued to make headlines for his comments about women, including his claim that he could grope women without their consent because he is a celebrity. ""I've had women come up to me and say, 'Mr. Trump, have you ever done this to you?' And I'm like, 'What do you mean, have you ever done this to me?'"" Trump told Howard Stern in 2005. ""It's a beautiful thing to be able to do that with a star on your back, you know. And I'm not a star."" The Republican nominee was asked to explain his comments during a town hall in South Carolina on Wednesday, and he did not hold back. ""When you're a star, they let you do it,"" Trump said. ""You can do anything."" Trump also said that women who have been groped"
155;Quasi-War was;a series of wars between the Imperium of Man and the Ork Waaagh! in the 41st Millennium. Contents show] History Edit The war began with the discovery of a new warp rift on the planet Skaros, which led to the formation of the Imperial Fists Space Marine Chapter of Ultramarines. This Chapter was led by the Primarch Roboute Guilliman, who took the planet as his base of operations after his ascension to the position of Warmaster of the Imperium in 999.M41. Guilliman had a long-standing grudge against the Eldar, who had invaded his homeworld of Iyanden during the Great Crusade and forced him to flee to the Eye of Terror, where he became embroiled in a civil war between the Eldar and the Imperium. In order to quell the conflict, Guilliman sent a fleet of Imperial Fists Space Marines to the planet Skaros to investigate the Warp
156;Alien and Sedition Acts was;"the first to use the term ""treason"" in reference to the United States. On June 17, 1798, the House of Burgesses passed a resolution declaring that ""all persons who have taken part in the seditious insurrection against the government of the United States are traitors to the same, and shall be punished by death or other punishment in accordance with the law of the land."" This resolution was followed by an equally strong resolution from the House of Delegates that same day, stating that ""the House of Delegates of the United Colonies have resolved to make a full and strict investigation of the acts of the government of the United States, and if they shall find any of them repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, they shall take such action as they shall deem expedient in order to effect their purpose."" In 1801, President James Madison wrote to John Quincy Adams, who was in the White House at the time, urging him to ""exercise"
157;How did the Alien and Sedition Acts interfere with the lives of people living in the United States?;"A few years ago I was asked to give a talk at a college in New York on the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. This was a time of great excitement in the history of the United States. It was the beginning of the Civil War, and the war was going to last a long time. I had a lot of people in the audience who were interested in my talk, and one of them said, ""What is the difference between a slave and a free man?"" The question struck me as an odd one, because the Constitution does not give a right to free people to be slaves. It says ""all men are created equal,"" and that is the basis of the Constitution. But there is a clause in the Constitution that says the Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and that includes the importation of slaves. The slave trade was one of the most important things that the Congress could do in its power to regulate commerce. It was a matter of"
158;How did France and Great Britain test American neutrality?;"The French were in a position to do so because they had a fleet of battleships at their disposal. In 1812, the United States and Britain signed a treaty that guaranteed the neutrality of the Atlantic Ocean, but it did not apply to the Mediterranean or North Atlantic. France's fleet was based in the port of Brest, which was the closest French port to the American coast. It was in Brest that French Admiral Leclerc, commander of the navy in the Mediterranean, sent a message to President James Madison on April 9, 1812, asking for American neutrality. Madison replied that he would have no objection to France's neutrality, but he did have a problem with the French admiral's request to be allowed to sail to the Mediterranean and ""take part in the war against Spain."" The American response was to say that they would be ""willing to make the most strenuous efforts to prevent the passage of any French warship, and to protect the rights of American citizens"
159;The amendment stipulates that electoral votes for president and vice president are counted and listed separately.;"The new rules were approved by the National Assembly on Wednesday and will take effect in the first half of 2018. A total of 5,716 people were elected to the National Assembly, which is made up of representatives from each of the country's provinces and the capital, Brasilia. President Michel Temer's approval rating is at its lowest since taking office in 2015, according to a poll published on Wednesday by Folha de S.Paulo. The poll showed Temer's approval rating fell to 36 percent, compared to 43 percent in the previous poll, which was conducted last month.

160;Which states split their electoral votes between Jefferson and Adams?;The most recent data I could find is from 2000, when there were two states that split their electoral votes between Adams and Jefferson. In that election, Adams won a total of 5 electoral votes, while Jefferson won 4. What's the difference between a winner-take-all and winner-take-all-by-popular-vote system? In a winner-take-all system, the winner of the popular vote is the candidate who receives the most votes in the state, regardless of how many states are involved. This is known as a single-winner system. In a winner-take-all system, the winner of the popular vote is the candidate who receives the most votes in all 50 states and the District ofColumbia. This is known as a multi-winner system. Why do we care about this? Because it's important to know which candidate will win the Electoral College in your state. If you live in a state that has
161;Write an editorial that responds to George Washington’s Farewell Address.;In a world of ever-increasing inequality, we need to think about how the United States can be a beacon of hope for those who have fallen through the cracks. That's why I'm proud to announce my candidacy for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. As a child of the Great Depression, I grew up in a working-class neighborhood in New York City. My father worked as a janitor at a garment factory, and my mother was a homemaker. As a young woman, I joined the Women's Suffrage Association, a group that fought for women's rights in the 1930s and 1940s. In those days, women were denied the right to vote, and the Equal Rights Amendment was a long way from becoming law. But we stood up to our oppressors, and our fight was never in vain. Today, women make up half of the workforce, and we have more women in Congress than ever before. But the glass ceiling remains
162;John Marshall was;one of the most prolific writers of the 20th century. He wrote a book every two weeks or so, which is a lot of books to keep track of. In his spare time, Marshall spent time with his wife and two children in the summer and winter of 1891-92. His writing was prolific, and it took him more than a year to finish his book on the history of baseball and its history in the United States. The book was published in 1892 under the title Baseball in America, and it sold more than 1,000 copies in its first year of publication. Marshall had an interest in baseball from a young age, and he began playing the game when he was five years old. His father, a railroad worker, encouraged him to become a professional baseball player, and Marshall did just that by the time he was in his 20s. In addition to his work as a writer, Marshall was an avid baseball fan and a member of the
163;Louisiana Purchase was;"the first to use the term ""Indian"" in reference to the Indians. 1820 - In an effort to gain support for the Louisiana Purchase, Congress passed the Act of 1820, which authorized the United States to purchase Louisiana from France and the Spanish in exchange for $100,000,000 in gold bullion. This was followed by the Act of 1822, which authorized the U.S. to purchase all of the territory west of the Mississippi River, except for a portion of the Mississippi Valley, which was to be ceded to Great Britain. 1822 - President James K. Polk signed the Louisiana Purchase Act into law on March 2, 1822. The purchase price was $100,000,000 in gold and was divided into three parts: Louisiana, Louisiana and Mississippi. 1823 - The first shipment of gold was sent to New Orleans by the French under the command of General de L'Isle-aux-Traverses. It was"
164;Meriwether Lewis was;"a slave in the antebellum South. The Civil War ended in 1865, and Lewis returned to North Carolina to work as a laborer for the U.S. Army. In 1867, he married Harriet Beecher Stowe, the daughter of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. The couple had three children, all of whom died in infancy. After the war, Lewis became a professor of African-American studies at Emory University in Atlanta, where he taught for 30 years. His research focused on the history of slavery in the United States, as well as the role of women in the abolitionist movement. In the 1960s, Lewis began to write a series of books that were critical of the civil rights movement and its leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. In one of his most famous books, ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X,"" Lewis wrote that King ""did not have the courage of his convictions and was willing to sacrifice"
165;William Clark was;"a member of the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II. He served as a fighter pilot in the Korean War and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service, according to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The NARA records show that Clark flew a B-17 Flying Fortress, which was one of the most advanced aircraft in the United States at the time. The Flying Fortress had a range of 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), was equipped with radar to detect enemy aircraft and could take off from land, sea or air bases. In addition to his flying duties, Clark was an expert gunner and had a degree in aeronautical engineering from West Point, New York. ""I have no idea what happened to him,"" his son-in-law, John Henshaw, told CNN on Monday. ""It's a mystery to me."" Henshaw said his father-in-law"
166;Sacagawea was;a slave to the United States. In 1838, she escaped from slavery to seek freedom for her people, and in 1842, she became the first woman to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. Her life was filled with struggles for women's rights, and she helped found the suffragette movement in the United States. The first African-American president of the United States was John Quincy Adams in 1841. During the Civil War, Harriet Tubman served as a nurse in the Union Army. In 1864, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, because she was black. The Supreme Court ruled in her favor in 1955. On April 14, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee. His dream of ending racial segregation in the United States was realized with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The first female presidential candidate was Hillary
167;Zebulon Pike was;"a member of the Blackwater security team in Iraq. Pike's death comes as the Obama administration prepares to hand over control of the war in Afghanistan to Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who has vowed to fight the Taliban and al Shabaab, the Islamic militants who have taken over large swaths of the country. The White House said in a statement that Pike ""gave his life to protect the lives of his fellow soldiers and to keep America safe from those who would do us harm."" ""We send our thoughts and prayers to his family and loved ones during this difficult time,"" the statement said. A spokesman for the National Security Council, Ned Price, told ABC News on Monday that he could not comment on Pike's death, but added that ""there is no greater honor than to serve our country in uniform."" Pike, an Air Force reservist from San Diego, was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, according to the"
168;How did the Supreme Court decision in Marbury v. Madison strengthen the federal judiciary?;"It's hard to say what the answer is to that question without looking at the history of the Court's decisions, which have changed over time. But one thing is clear: In a number of cases, the Court has been willing to strike down laws that it deemed unconstitutionally vague, overbroad, or unduly burdensome to the exercise of First Amendment rights. For example, in 1869, the Court invalidated a New York law that forbade ""false and scandalous reports of the commission of a crime"" to the public. The Court held that the law ""restrains the freedom of speech and is in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment,"" which guarantees freedom of speech and the press. (This was the first time the Court struck down a state law on this basis.) A year later, in 1872, the Court struck down a New York law that made it a crime to publish a libelous or defamatory statement about a public"
169;How was Jefferson’s presidency similar to and different from those of Washington and Adams in political style, goals, and foreign policy?;Jefferson was a man of his time and his time was the 1790s. He did not have the time or the inclination to think about the future, much less how to deal with a world in which there were so many competing interests and so many people who wanted to be in the best position to make a difference. His focus was on what was at that time the most important thing to him—the preservation of the Union, which was a matter of life and death for his country. That was his focus and that was what he was going to do as president. The first thing I want to say is that I am not trying to make a judgment about Jefferson's presidency based on my reading of his writings. That is not what I am doing in this book. My book is an attempt to give a sense of what it was like to be a citizen of the United States in the years leading up to the Civil War and the war itself. It is a book about
170;Why do you think Pierre L’Enfant designed the city with wide avenues and circular intersections?;It was a way to get people to the center of the city without having to go all the way to Montréal. I think the city has been designed in a way that makes it easy to get to the center, but not so easy to get out of the city. What are your thoughts on the city's architecture, and how it relates to Montreal's history? I'm a big fan of the city's architecture, and I think it's one of the best in North America. I think Montreal is a city that's very well-preserved and has a lot of history to it. It's not the most modern city out there, but there's so much that's beautiful in the city that you can't help but love it. Do you have a favorite street in Montreal? The one that's closest to my house is La Petite Parc, which is a street that runs through the heart of the city. It's

172;Non-Intercourse Act was;a non-binding recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO). What is the difference between a condom and a spermicide? Condoms are made of latex and spermicide is a preservative that prevents sperm from fertilizing an egg. The WHO recommends that men use condoms every time they have sex with a new partner, but there is no evidence that this is effective in preventing STDs. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases found that condoms were associated with an increased risk of HIV infection in men who had sex with men (MSM), but not in those who did not. This may be due to the fact that MSM are more likely to use condoms than heterosexual men, which may have led to the results being confounded by condom use. Spermicide is an antiseptic used to treat sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and trichomoniasis. It has
173;Tecumseh was;"one of the most successful cities in the United States. It had a population of 1,500,000 in 1885 and was the largest city in the state of New York at the time (the city of Albany, which was located in upstate New York, had a population of about 400,000). Tecumseh's population grew rapidly during the 19th century, peaking in 1900 at 2,000,000 and declining to a low of 1,000,000 in the 1930s. The city has been in decline ever since; in 2010, it had a population of just 694,000. A number of factors contributed to this decline, including population growth in the suburbs, urban sprawl, and the decline of manufacturing jobs that were once the lifeblood of the city. But one of the most significant factors was the development of Interstate 95, which cut off the city from the rest of the state for more than a decade. This was a"
174;William Henry Harrison was;"born in 1809. He served as a private in the U.S. Army from 1812 to 1814 and was promoted to major in 1814. Harrison's career took a turn for the worse when he was accused of being a spy for the British during the War of 1812. The charges were dismissed, but Harrison lost his pension and was forced to pay a fine of $1,000 to the government. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching!

In 1833, Harrison married Martha Custis, a native of England who had immigrated to the United"
175;Oliver Perry was;one of the most prolific writers of the 20th century. He wrote a total of 1,744 novels, short stories, poetry, and nonfictional works between 1884 and his death in 1937 (the last year of his life). Perry's works are divided into three categories: historical fiction, science fiction, and fantasy. The first category consists of stories set in the world of his time and time before the invention of the typewriter, while the second is a mix of historical fiction and science fiction. The third category is his most famous work, The Time Machine, which has been adapted for the silver screen and made into a feature film starring Harrison Ford in the 1980s. Here are some of Perry's most famous works: 1. A Visit from the Goon Squad (1925) This is the story of a boy who travels to another world to find his father, only to find the world in ruins and an army of goons
176;Hartford Convention was;a success. In the summer of 1837, the convention voted to establish a state bank, which was the first step in the creation of the U.S. Treasury Department. The state bank had the power to issue notes and issue bank notes to the state's citizens as well as to foreign banks that were willing to accept them. It was a major step in the process of nationalizing the banking system in the United States. On July 1, 1837, President Andrew Jackson signed the Bank Act of 1792 into law. This act gave the Federal Reserve System the power to issue currency, and it created the Federal Reserve Bank in New York City. The Bank Act of 1792 was one of the most important pieces of legislation in American history, and it set the stage for the Federal Reserve System to take over the U.S. banking system. After the Bank Act of 1792, the Federal Reserve System began to expand its power and control over the American economy
177;Treaty of Ghent was;signed in 1713. The treaty established the rights of the Holy Roman Empire to trade with the Dutch East India Company, which was the first to set up a trading post in the New World. But the Dutch had a problem: they wanted to keep their monopoly on sugar, and they were unwilling to give up that monopoly without a fight. So they started an all-out war, which lasted from 1715 to 1717. The Dutch lost more than a third of their ships and nearly as many men in the fighting. In a few months, the Dutch East India Company was reduced to a bankrupt state, and the Treaty of Utrecht became the foundation of the Dutch-American trade agreement. Today, there are two ways to look at this: one is as a triumph of diplomacy, and the other is as a tragedy of war. But both sides have to be considered in the context of the time and place they were dealing with. As an American historian,
178;Analyze why Perry’s victory on Lake Erie was important for the Americans.;What is your take on Perry’s victory on Lake Erie? I think it was a great win for the U.S. and the team as a whole. We had a lot of momentum going into the game and it was great to see our fans come out in droves to support us. It was an emotional game, but the team did a great job of staying in the game until the final buzzer sounded. How important was it for the Americans to win in front of their home fans? It was important for all of us, not just Perry. It was a great way to end the World Cup of Hockey and we're looking forward to next year's tournament in Russia. Who was your favorite player to watch on the ice and why? My favorite player to watch was Tyler Seguin. He was the best player on the ice and I loved his ability to find the back of the net. He had a great
179;What did Tecumseh’s death signify for Native Americans of the Northwest Territory?;"Tecumseh was a symbol of the death of an Indian, and his death symbolized the end of a life that was marked by violence and death. He died at the age of 24, the age at which many of his people began to lose their ability to hunt and gather, and the age at which they became dependent on the land for survival. What is the significance of the ""C"" in Tecumseh's name? The ""C"" stands for Chief, and is a Native American word meaning ""chief"" or ""leader."" It has been used to refer to the head of a chief for thousands of years. In this case, the Chief of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation was known as ""The Chief"" or ""The Conecuh Chief."" Why do you think the name was changed to Tecumseh? The name ""Tecumseh"" was given to the"
180;How did the War of 1812 affect the United States?;It was a war of the people against the government, and in many ways that's the most important aspect of the War of 1812. The people were fighting for their rights, and the government was trying to take those rights away from them. What was the role of the federal government in the war? There were two federal governments at the time: the British and the U.S. Both were in the throes of civil war, and they had to work together to get things done. The British government wanted to annex New York, and the U.S. wanted to annex the Northwest Territory (present-day Washington, D.C.). So they were fighting for the same thing: control of the territory that was part of the United States. How did the War of 1812 affect Native Americans? The War of 1812 did a lot of damage to Native Americans, but not as much as you might think. In fact, it's
181;Think of an event that made you feel patriotic about the United States. Write a paragraph explaining why the event made you feel this way.;"For example, you might write about a trip you took to the Grand Canyon in your high school yearbook. The trip was a highlight of your life, and you were proud to show off your skills as a geologist by taking a look at the canyon from the top. Now that you're older, what would you say to someone who asked, ""Why did you go to the Grand Canyon?"" The point is, it's not enough to say ""I went to the Grand Canyon"" or ""I was a member of the Boy Scouts of America."" You have to go into the event with a sense of pride and a desire to share that pride with others. 3. Be a role model for your children and encourage them to do the same. When you're in the middle of a project, or you're working on a project with your kids, make sure you're the one who gets the credit for the work and the credit goes to the child,"
182;Era of Good Feelings was;"a good time to be a fan of the band. In the mid-90s, they began to make a name for themselves as one of the most popular bands in the U.S. and the rest of the world thanks to their hit singles ""Someday"" and ""You're Gonna Miss Me,"" which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and were certified triple platinum by the RIAA (Record Industry Association of America). The band had a successful tour in support of their debut album, and in 1997, they signed with Warner Bros. Records to release their second album, A Farewell to Kings, which sold over 1.5 million copies in the United States and Canada, as well as in other countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. A Farewell to Kings was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 1998, and the following year, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
183;John C. Calhoun was;"a slave owner. In 1838, he wrote a letter to his son-in-law, William H. Seward, asking for a loan to buy land in South Carolina. The letter was sent in the middle of the Civil War, and Seward's response was, ""I have no objection to the purchase of land, but it is my duty to do all in my power to prevent the introduction of slavery into my State."" Seward went on to serve as President of the United States from 1845 to 1849, and in that time, slavery was legal in the South. The South Carolina slave trade continued to be a source of revenue for the state, and Calhoun continued to be a slave owner. In 1849, Calhoun wrote another letter to his son-in-law, writing, ""I am a slave owner, and if I could get rid of my slaves, I would do it in a few years, but I cannot"

I love my wife and my kids, and I'm going to do everything I can to make sure they're safe."" The Associated Press contributed to this report."
185;Adam-Onís Treaty was;the first of its kind. It established a framework to protect the rights of Indigenous peoples and their cultural heritage in accordance with Canadaís treaty obligations. This treaty has been ratified by every country in the world except the United States of America where it has been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada. The Treaty of Waitangi is an important part of the history of New Zealand and a testament to the strength of our people and our commitment to protect our land and our way of life. We are proud to stand with the Treaty of Waitangi and look forward to the day when it is enshrined in law as the law of the land.
186;Quadruple Alliance was;the name of a coalition of the most powerful corporations in the EVE universe. Contents show] History Edit Early history Edit The Alliance began to form in the aftermath of the Battle of Delve, a war that took place on the planet Tarsonis between the Caldari State and the Gallente Federation. The alliance had its roots in the alliance of corporations known as the Black Eagle Alliance.[1] The first meeting of the alliance was held in New Eden's capital, Amarr Station, where they decided to form a coalition to fight for the rights of the Caldari and Gallente peoples, as well as their right to self-determination in the game. This was a time of political and economic turmoil in New Eden, and it was hoped that the alliance would be able to bring order to the chaos and create a more peaceful world. However, the alliance was plagued by infighting and internal conflicts, and many of its members began to lose faith in
187;Summarize how the Supreme Court rulings in McCulloch v. Maryland and Gibbons v. Ogden strengthened the federal government.;Explain how the Supreme Court has been a force for good in the United States and around the world. What is the most important lesson you learned from your time as a Supreme Court Justice? It is a lesson that is applicable to every aspect of our lives and the way we live our lives. The Court is an institution that serves the public interest, not the other way around. We have a responsibility to make sure that the Court does not become a tool of special interests, but a tool of the people. Why do you think the justices are such a powerful force in American life? I think it is because of their integrity, their ability to think for themselves, and their ability to be open to new ideas that challenge the status quo. They are not beholden to any party or interest group, and that is a good thing. How would you describe your relationship with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg? We are close friends,
188;How did the Monroe Doctrine reinforce President Washington’s foreign policy goals?;In 1812, Washington was in the midst of a war with Great Britain over the South Sea, which was a vital trade route for the United States. The British had seized control of the Straits of Magellan, which led to the opening of the Atlantic and a flood of ships from all over the world to trade with the West Indies (now the United States). In addition, the American Revolution had been going on for a few years, and many Americans wanted to join the fight against the British. Washington saw this as an opportunity to expand his empire, and he sent a letter to his secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, asking for help in this regard. Adams, who at the time was a New York congressman, responded with a letter of his own, which was published in the New York Tribune on July 2, 1812. The Monroe Doctrine was one of the most important documents in the history of American foreign policy, and it laid the foundation for America's role in the
189;How did nationalism affect the foreign affairs of the United States?;Nationalism is a form of patriotism, and the U.S. has been a nation since 1776. In that time, Americans have fought and died to defend the rights of their fellow citizens, and we have been at the forefront of world affairs for the better part of two centuries. But nationalism can have a corrosive effect on our foreign policy if it becomes the basis for a belief that the nation is above other nations and should have the right to decide who gets to live and who does not. This is what happened in the 1930s and 1940s, when the American people were led to believe that they had a right to rule the world by military force and the threat of nuclear annihilation. In World War II, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, which was the first time in American history that a nation had attacked another nation without a declaration of war. This set off a chain of events that led to the Cold War, and the rise of the Soviet Union in
190;Imagine you are an editor of a newspaper in Spanish-held Florida. Write an editorial in which you either attack or defend the actions of Andrew Jackson and his militia in seizing Spanish settlements in Florida.;"What's the headline of your editorial? The answer is ""No, you're wrong."" It's a clear case of libel, and you can be sued for that. In the United States, libel is a form of false news reporting that harms the reputation of a person or group of people. The Supreme Court has held that ""libel may be actionable under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which protects freedom of speech and the press."" (Emphasis added by Legal Insurrection.) That's a big deal, because it means that the government can take action against anyone who says something defamatory about the government, or someone in the government. So how does this play out in real life? Let's take a look at some examples of what's known as ""public figures"" who have been sued for libel: 1. George W. Bush, President of the United States: In 2003, a New York Times reporter, Judith Miller,"
191;National Road was;"the first to use the name ""Horse and Carriage"" in 1845. The name is derived from the Latin word cara, meaning ""horse"" or ""cavalry"", and the Greek word karos, meaning ""road"". It was used as a brand name for a number of horse and carriage manufacturers in the 19th century and early 20th century, including William Morris & Co. (founded in 1826), Henry J. Pemberton (1829-1892), and the Coopers & Lyceums Company (1902-1910). In 1912, the company changed its name to Horse and Carriage Company of New York, Inc. and was reincorporated in 1916 under the name ""Horse and Carriage Company of the United States of America"". Today, the company continues to manufacture and sell a wide range of products, including saddles, bridles, harnesses, saddles for mules and"
192;Robert Fulton was;a member of the U.S. Army and served in World War II. He died in 2007 at the age of 92. Fulton's story is a cautionary tale for those who believe the world is flat, or at least that there is no curvature to the Earth. In the 1940s, Fulton, an Air Force pilot, flew over the South Pole in a B-25 bomber, which had to make a 180-degree turn to avoid a storm. The storm blew the plane off course and forced Fulton to land on the ice and snow below. He spent the next two days in a snowdrift-infested hut with no food or water until his rescue by a group of soldiers led by Lt. Col. John Hensley. Hensley had been on a mission to find the source of radio signals that had been picked up by the German Luftwaffe, and he wanted to know if they were coming from the South Pole. The
193;Industrial Revolution was;the result of a long process. In 1815 there were no steam engines, no electric lighting, no telephone, no telegraph, no television, no television sets, no radio, no radio transmitters, no telephonic communication, no television, no radio receivers, no telephone lines, no telegraphs, no telephone exchanges, no radio transmitters, no radio receivers, no telephonic communicators (except in London, which had a telephone exchange in the 1790s and was one of the first to have an intercontinental radio transmission in 1876), and no television. The world was in the dark for a long time, and that's what we're dealing with here. It's not a coincidence that the industrial revolution took place in the middle of the 19th century, which was the age of railroads, the first commercial airship, the first steam locomotives, the first electricity, etc. So what's the point of all this?
194;Francis C. Lowell,Eli Whitney was;"born in 1833 and came to the United States in 1845. His father, a merchant, was an Irishman and his mother, a native of Ireland. The family settled in New York, where they owned a farm and lived in a log house on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street. He studied law at Columbia University and was admitted to the bar in 1869. After a year's practice, he entered the law office of Mr. and Mrs. E. C. Lowell, of the same address, and became a partner in the firm of Lowell & Co., which was established in 1871. In 1875 he was married to the daughter of the late Rev. John A. Houghton, of St. Louis, Mo. Their children were: Charles, who died in infancy; Mary (deceased), a school teacher; and Eunice, who died of typhoid fever at the age of twenty-six. Mr. Lowell was a member"
195;Samuel F.B. Morse was;"born in 1838. He studied law with his father, and in the fall of 1867 entered the law office of J. W. Moseley, where he remained until his death in 1892. Mr. Morse was a member of the Swedish-Lutheran church, and served as a committee of the First Swedish Lutheran Congregational Church of St. Paul and the first Swedish Lutheran church in the city of St. Paul. He married, October 2, 1869, Anna A. Johansson, and their children are: Ethel L., who died in infancy, and Edith M. (deceased), who is a stenographer for the City and County of St. Paul. The following is a list of the members of the firm of Morse & Co., which has been in business for more than sixty years: Samuel Morse, jun., president; J. C. Morse, vice-president; A. B.

196;List the changes that occurred as a result of the Industrial Revolution.;This is a list of every change that took place in the United Kingdom between 1650 and the present day. It is based on data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which has been collating and analysing this data since 1851. The ONS is the UK's official statistics agency and provides a wide range of statistics on a wide range of topics, including employment, income, housing, health, education, crime, transport and the environment. In order to make it easier for people to find information, we have broken down the data into three main categories: industrial revolution, post-industrial revolution and modernisation. This means that you can search for a change by selecting one of the three subcategories and clicking on the search results. For example, if you are looking for the number of people working in manufacturing, you can search for'manufacturing' in the first subcategory and 'post-industrial revolution' in the second subcategory. Indust
197;Describe advances that were made in transportation during this period.;A number of factors contributed to the development of the railroads, including the introduction of steam locomotives in 1869, the development of the telegraph in 1872, and the advent of electrification in 1877. These developments made it possible to move large quantities of freight at low cost and with little interruption to service. In addition, improvements in the transportation of freight and passengers led to an increase in the number of railroads and a corresponding increase in passenger traffic. What was the most important factor in the development of the railroads? The railroad was the most important factor in the development of the United States, and it is important to note that this was not a one-way street. As early as the 1830s, there were several railroad companies operating in the West, including the Union Pacific (which was incorporated in 1832), the Western Pacific (which was incorporated in 1836), and the New York Central (which was incorporated in 1837). By
198;How did the concept of interchangeable parts revolutionize the manufacturing process?;It was a combination of factors. First, we were able to make parts that were interchangeable in one part, but not in another. This allowed us to reduce the cost of manufacturing by a factor of 10 or more. Second, the design of the parts was more flexible than it had been in the past. For example, a screw that used to be attached to a piece of metal could be made to fit on a piece of plastic, or vice versa. Third, there was a lot of experimentation with different materials, such as polycarbonate, which had been used for many years, but was very hard to work with. Finally, the use of computer-aided design (CAD) allowed us to design parts in a way that was much more efficient and cost-effective than ever before. What is the future of 3D printing? The technology is advancing at a rapid pace, and we are seeing new applications in everything from medical diagnostics to construction.
199;Why did early labor unions have little success?;The answer is that labor unions were a poor fit for the industrial economy of the 19th century. In the United States, there were two kinds of workers: those who worked for wages and those who worked for profit. The first group, the wage earners, were the majority of the population. Their job was to produce goods and services for the market, and they did so by hiring and firing workers, paying them according to their skill and productivity. The second group, the profit-making workers, were the owners of capital and had a different job: they bought and sold labor-power to the highest bidder. This was a world in which the worker was an individual, not a part of a collective. It was a world in which a worker could lose his job for no reason at all, and in which he could be laid off without any warning. The only way to keep a worker on the job was to make him work harder and longer than he was worth—and
200;Why were steamboats so much more efficient than other shipping methods of the time?;It's hard to say for sure, but one theory is that steamboats were able to get around the Great Lakes and the Mississippi by using water that was less dense than the lake water, which would have made it easier to move through the water. This was a problem for ships that had to go from New York to Boston, for example, because the water in the Mississippi was too dense to move through. What was the first steamboat in the United States? The first steamboat was built in 1818 by a shipbuilder named John Boulton, who built a boat that was about 20 feet (6 meters) long and weighed 1,000 tons (900 metric tons). Boulton was the first to build a steamboat on the West Coast of the United States, and he did it in a way that was similar to the way ships were built in other parts of the world at the time: he hired workers to build the boat, then used those
201;Imagine you are a teenager working in a textile factory in the early 1800s. Write a letter to your family describing your way of life as a factory worker.;What would you say in your letter? The first thing you would say is that you were born into a family of work, and that it was your father who taught you to work hard and not let your work get in the way of your family. Your family was poor, but you had a strong work ethic and were proud of your work. You would tell your family that you wanted to go to college, and that you hoped one day to become a doctor or a lawyer. But you knew that it was a long way off, and that the best way to get there was to start your own business. You would tell your family that you were a hard worker, and that you worked hard to make ends meet. You would tell them that you loved your family, and that you would do anything to help them out in any way you could. You would tell your family that you were an honest and hard worker, and that you never cheated anyone

In the end, it was the FBI that came up with the idea to go after the Silk Road and the Dread Pirate Roberts, according to court documents. But that's not the end of the story. The FBI has been trying to figure out how to take down the site for a while, with little success. In a statement to Motherboard, the FBI said it ""continues to work with law enforcement partners to identify and bring to justice those who pose a threat to the public, our nation's security, and our economy."" ""This investigation is ongoing and we will continue to take steps to ensure that criminals do not have safe havens to sell illegal goods and services,"" the statement continued.

203;gang system was;"the first to use the ""bump and run"" technique. In an interview with ABC News, he said the technique ""allows you to get a lot of information from a small amount of information and it's very, I think, effective in the war on terror."" ""We have a lot of information that the Taliban and al Shabaab are using to plan attacks against the United States and our allies,"" he said. ""And the best way to get that information is to go into a village or a village-type area where there are a lot of people, and you bump into them and ask them a question, and if they have something to tell you, you can ask them that question. That's what we did in Kandahar, and it worked very well."" The U.S. military has used the technique for years, but it's never been used in a combat situation.

205;Frederick Douglass was;born in 1818. His father, a slave, owned land in South Carolina, and the family moved there when Frederick was three years old. Frederick grew up in a slave household, and as a young man he worked as a laborer on a plantation owned by his father. After graduating from high school, Frederick went to work for the United States Department of Agriculture, where he learned to read and write. In 1852, at the age of twenty-one, he became the first African-American to receive a Ph.D. in botany from the University of Pennsylvania. Douglass continued his research into plant and animal life and eventually published his first book, A Compendious Account of the Plantations and Cultivations of the South, in 1856. The book was a bestseller, and Douglass was invited to speak at the opening of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. in 1857. In the years that followed,
206;Denmark Vesey was;one of the most prolific scorers in the history of the NHL. He scored a total of 1,724 goals and 1,824 assists in 913 regular season games, which is an average of 0.78 goals per game. Vesey's scoring prowess was on display in the Stanley Cup Playoffs as he scored three goals and an assist in the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Pittsburgh Penguins. The goal was his first of the playoffs and the assist was his second of the playoff series. In addition to his scoring prowess, Vesey was a two-time All-Star and won the Selke Trophy as the league's top defensive forward in 1997-98. Vietnam Vesey played for the United States at the 1998 World Cup of Hockey in Nagano, Japan. He had a career-high nine points (3G, 5A) in seven games. Vietnam Vesey was drafted by the New
207;Nat Turner was;"a slave. In 1831, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that slavery was legal in the District of Columbia, which is the home of the White House. This decision was based on the D.C. Constitution, which states that ""No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due."" But that's not the end of the story. As we know, slaves had to be brought to the U.S. by their owners, and the owners were free to sell them as they saw fit. In other words, they were property in the eyes of the law. So what happened to the slaves who escaped from slavery in the District of Columbia? They were sold into slavery in the Deep South, where they were"

209;How did cotton farming change the South? What aspects of Southern life stayed the same?;Cotton was the first crop to be grown in the United States and it's a staple in the South. The South has always been a land of farmers, and farmers are the heart and soul of the South. They are the ones who grow the food that sustains the people, and that's what cotton is all about. How did cotton farming change the South? What aspects of Southern life stayed the same? In 1820, there were no cotton fields in the South. It was a small patch of land that was farmed by slave labor. But by the end of the 19th century, cotton fields were common in the South, and they became an important part of the economy. What was the impact of slavery on the South? Slave labor was essential to the cotton industry. Slaves were paid $1 a day for their labor, which was more than the wages of other workers in the South. The slave labor system created a
210;Why was song an important part of the enslaved African American culture?;"It was a way to keep the slaves from leaving the plantation, so they could be used as labor for the plantation owners. The song was sung in front of the slaves and the slave owners, and it was used as a warning to the slaves not to run away from the plantation. How did this song come to be known as ""Hail to the Chief""? In 1838, a group of African-American slaves in the Deep South called the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) began singing the hymn ""Hail to the Chief"" to raise money for the war effort. The song had its origins in the Civil War, but it was popularized by abolitionists and became a rallying cry for the South during the Reconstruction era. What is the origin of the song ""I Have a Dream"" and why is it important to this story? The song ""I Have a Dream"" was written by John Philip Sousa, who was"
211;Imagine you are a European visitor to the South in 1830. Write a letter home explaining your impressions of life in this part of the nation.;"What would you say to your mother-in-law who had been born and raised in New York, the home of the most famous university in the world? How would you answer her question: ""Why do you want to go to the South?"" The answer is simple: you want to escape the poverty, disease, and social ills that plague the United States of America. And if you are an American, you want to do it by way of a new and better life for yourself and your loved ones. That is why it is so important that you visit the South, and not just for pleasure, but as a means of making a difference in the lives of those who live there. In 1831, President Andrew Jackson issued a proclamation to the people of the South that called for the ""abolition of slavery within the limits of the United States."" This proclamation was the first of its kind in the history of the United States, and its effect was to bring"
212;Missouri Compromise was;a major step in the right direction. But it's not enough to make Missouri a model for the rest of the country. We need to do more, and that starts with fixing the problems that led to the state's fiscal crisis in the first place. Missouri has the highest per-capita income in the country, but that's not the only reason it's in the red. The state's tax burden is among the highest in the country, as well as one of the highest in the Midwest. And while Missourians pay a lot of taxes to support schools, health care and other services, they're not getting the bang for their buck. In the past five years, state revenue has fallen $1.5 billion short of what's needed to pay for education, public safety and other services. That's more than a quarter of the state's budget. The problem is compounded by a lack of investment in our state's infrastructure, which is crumbling
213;Henry Clay was;a slave. In 1838, the Supreme Court ruled that slavery was legal in the United States, a decision that would have a profound impact on the lives of African Americans for generations to come. But that decision did not come without a price. For one thing, the decision opened the door to Jim Crow laws, which prohibited black people from owning property, voting, serving on juries — and, of course, being free. For another, it gave birth to the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist organization that terrorized black people and their property for more than a century. And for yet another, it helped pave the way for America's Civil War, which ended in 1865 with the Union victory. So what happened to the slaves who were freed after the Civil War? Did they go back to their homes, or were they sold into slavery again? It's a question that historians have grappled with for decades, and the answer is

The crash killed Crawford and two passengers, a flight attendant and a baggage handler. In an interview with ABC News, Crawford said he had no idea what was going on in the cockpit when he lost control of his plane. ""I thought it was going to hit the ground, but it kept going,"" he said. ""The only thing I could think of was, 'What the hell is going on?' "" Crawford, who is survived by his wife, two children and a stepson, said he was ""shocked"" to learn"
215;American System was;the result of a long-term effort to improve the health and well-being of the people of New York. In 1848, the city had a population of 1,000,000 and an annual tax rate of 6.5 percent. By the mid-19th century, the population had grown to more than 6 million, and the tax rate was reduced to 3 percent. The result was a reduction in infant mortality, improved sanitation, and an increase in life expectancy. New York became a center of manufacturing and the financial and industrial capital of the United States. During the Civil War, New York was one of the most important cities in the Union, and its citizens fought for the right to keep and bear arms. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guaranteed the right to keep and bear arms, and in 1866, a city ordinance was passed prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons on the streets of the city. This ordinance was upheld by the Supreme Court in
216;Democratic-Republican was;the party of Abraham Lincoln. In 1856, a group of Republican senators led by John C. Calhoon proposed the Electoral College to replace the winner-take-all system that had been in place since 1789. The idea was that each state would have a number of electors equal to its number of representatives in the House of Representatives, and the candidate who won the most votes in a state would be elected president. This system, known as plurality voting, was a favorite of the Whigs, who favored direct democracy, rather than the popular vote. But the Whigs were outvoted in the House of Representatives, and the system was abandoned in favor of the Electoral College, which had its origins in the Articles of Confederation.

217;Compare the different campaign strategies of the candidates in the 1824 election.;Candidate A's campaign was to raise money for his campaign by soliciting the support of the rich and powerful, while Candidate B's campaign was to win the election by mobilizing the working class and the poor against the rich and powerful. Both campaigns relied on the use of propaganda, which is a method of spreading information to the masses and persuading them to support one or the other candidate. In this election, the candidate with the most money was the one who was able to use propaganda the most effectively. This is the reason why, despite the fact that the election was a close one, it was decided by a margin of less than one percentage point. The difference between the two campaigns can be seen by comparing the amount of money each candidate spent on his or her campaign. Candidate A spent $5,000,000 on his campaign and Candidate B spent $2,000,000 on his campaign. This means that Candidate A had a total of $5,000,

219;Why do you think the candidates in the 1828 election focused on mudslinging instead of issues?;It's a question that has been asked a thousand times in this country, and I'm going to give an answer that's not a rhetorical question. The reason is simple: mudslinging is the last thing a politician wants to do when he or she is trying to win an election. It's an easy way to alienate voters, and that's what's happened in the last two elections. What is your take on Donald Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants being rapists and drug mules? He's a racist, and that's the bottom line. The fact of the matter is that there are millions of people in this country who are undocumented, and they have a right to be here. They have a right to live in this country without fear of being deported, and that's what Donald Trump is talking about. Do you think Hillary Clinton has the temperament to be president? No, I don't think she has the temperament to be president

The good news is that there are a number of ways to reduce the time it takes to vote, including voting early, getting a photo ID at the polls, and registering to vote in person. Here's a look at each of these options, along with how they can help you make the most of your time in the voting booth.

Voting Early

223;Tariff of Abominations was;"a set of rules that the Wizards of the Coast used to determine which cards were legal for play. Contents show] History Edit The rules were created by Mark Rosewater in an effort to create a game that was fun for all players, regardless of skill level.[1] He believed that Magic: The Gathering was too complex and that players would get bored if they had to memorize every rule in the book every time they played a game. Rosewater wanted to simplify the game by making it more accessible to new players and players who had no interest in playing Magic, such as the elderly, children, and those with physical handicaps. In addition, he wanted to encourage players to play in small groups, as it was easier to communicate with a small group of people than it was with a large group of people. The first set of rules was released on August 1, 1994, and they were named ""The Unhinged"" and contained the following:"
224;Daniel Webster was;"a student at St. John's University in New York when he began to feel his heart pounding in his chest. The 23-year-old had a heart murmur that doctors diagnosed as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a condition that causes heart muscle to become abnormally large in relation to the rest of the body. Webster, who is from Toronto, said he was shocked to learn that his condition could be caused by stress, such as working long hours or living in a stressful environment. ""I thought it was a joke,"" Webster told CTV Toronto on Tuesday. ""When I went to the doctor, they told me I had HCM, which is the most common cause of heart murmur in the United States and Canada."" The symptoms of HCM are similar to those of coronary artery disease, but it is not known why some people are more susceptible to the condition than others. Symptoms include shortness of breath"
225;Force Bill was;"a big deal. I remember the first time I saw it in the movie ""A Clockwork Orange,"" it was like a scene from the movie. ""The only thing that's going to stop me from getting my head blown off is you, Mr. President."" And that's what it was like to be a part of that moment. It was an amazing experience and one of the most memorable moments of my life. What was your reaction when you found out the President had signed the bill into law? My reaction was, ""Oh my God, this is great. We're going to have a lot of people in jail for a long time and that's a good thing."" But the real question is, how do you feel about the President of the United States, Barack Obama, signing a bill that's going to send people to jail for life if they're caught with a plant in their back pocket? That's a tough question to answer"
226;Indian Removal Act was;"a part of the Civil War. It's been said that the ""Great Emancipator"" would have been a slave owner, but that's not the case at all. In fact, slavery was abolished in the United States by the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution on December 6, 1865. The Thirteenth Amendment states: ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."" So what does that mean? It means that you are a citizen of the United States if you are born in the United States, regardless of where you were born. If you were born in a foreign country, your citizenship is based on the country in which you were born. For example, if you were born in the United States to an American citizen, you are a U.S. citizen. If you were born in a"
227;Trail of Tears was;"a book I read in the summer of 2010. It was the first time I read a book about the Rwandan genocide and the genocide in Darfur, which is where my family is from. In the book, there is a scene in which an American soldier, Sgt. John Walker Lindh, is shot and killed by a group of Hutu militia. This is the first time I had ever heard of the genocide, and I was shocked to learn that it was a genocidal campaign against Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The author, Paul Driessen, is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, and his book has been translated into more than a dozen languages. My first reaction was, ""What the hell is going on?"" But after reading the book, I began to understand the scope of the genocide and what was at stake. It was an atrocity that could have been prevented if Rwanda had the will to do so. I have a lot of"
228;Panic of 183 was;"a series of articles in The New York Times on the ""frightening rise of a cult of personality"" in the U.S. and around the world. The term is a portmanteau of ""freak"" and ""personality,"" referring to the belief that people are possessed by a spirit that can be seen, heard, touched, and felt in the form of an ""unseen hand"" or ""shadow."" In an effort to understand what was going on, I spoke with Dr. Robert Jay Lifton, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City who specializes in cults and the treatment of people who have joined them. Lifton told me that there are two types of personality disorders: those that are based on beliefs and those that are based on behavior. The first type, he said, ""is a kind of mental illness, like schizophrenia, where the person has a belief that they are in some kind of control over their life and"
229;Groups and Institutions In what ways did the United States become more democratic during Jackson’s presidency?;What is the relationship between the U.S. political system and civil rights? How did Jackson's presidency affect the development of the Democratic Party? Why did Jackson win the 1824 election and become the first African American president? The Civil War and Reconstruction Jackson was born in 1790 and grew up in a slave state. As a child, he witnessed the enslavement of his family and was forced to flee his home to escape the violence that was taking place in the South. After his father died in 1805, Jackson became one of the most prominent leaders of the anti-slavery movement, which led to the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which prohibited slavery in the United States. In 1820, Jackson became the first president to travel to the West Indies and the Caribbean, a first for a president and the first for a slave-owning president. The following year, he was elected to the U.S. House of
230;What effect did the Panic of 1837 have on the presidential election of 1840?;"It is hard to say for the most part; there are a number of factors that could have played a role in the election, such as the economic crisis of 1837-38, the Civil War, and the death of Andrew Jackson in 1845. However, one thing is certain: the Panic of 1837 was a turning point in American history. In the wake of the Panic, many Americans turned to the Federalist Party, which promised to restore the gold standard and protect the nation from foreign debt. This led to the creation of the Bank of the United States (BUS), which was the first bank in the world to issue currency backed by gold. The BUS became a central bank of the United States, and its charter was renewed in 1867. What is the relationship between the Panic of 1837 and the Great Depression of the 1930s? The Panic of 1837 is often cited as the beginning of the Great Depression, but this is not the"
231;Some wealthy Americans claimed that President Jackson’s supporters were a “mob” element in the nation. How does the artist portray Jackson’s supporters? Why do you think so?;"A lot of people have a hard time understanding what I'm trying to say, but it's a very simple question: What is it about this country that is the source of the hatred and the violence that we see on a daily basis? The answer is that this country is a slave society, and slavery is a part of our history. It has to do with the fact that we have a lot of land that was given to us by the British in the 17th and 18th centuries, and that's the reason why there are so many slave owners in this country. The people who own the land are the ones who control the government, and they have the power to enslave people. That's what happened in South Carolina, and it's what happened in other states as well. So, it's not a matter of race, it's a matter of power. In your book, you talk about the ""white man's burden"" and how white people are responsible for"

Write a letter to President Jackson giving your opinion of the Indian Removal Act.;What is the most important issue facing the Native American community today? I think it has to do with the lack of education and education is the number one issue that we are facing in this country. The education system is not doing a good job of educating our children and it needs to be fixed. We need to make sure that our children are getting the education that they need to be successful in today's world. How would you like to see the federal government spend money on education? I would like to see the Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services work together to create a system that is going to help the Native American community and give them the opportunity to succeed.

235;Charles Grandison Finney was;"a member of the Ku Klux Klan. In 1892, he married his first wife, Mary Ann Fennimore, and the couple had three children. Finney moved to Kansas City, Mo., to work as a stockbroker and eventually opened a grocery store, which he ran for a few years before selling it to another family. In 1894, he was elected to the Kansas City Board of Alderman, a position he held until his death in 1915. The Klan had a history of violence against African-Americans, and Finney's death was a blow to the organization. He was buried in a Confederate cemetery in Kansas City, but his remains were interred in St. John's Cemetery in the heart of the city. ""I think it's sad,"" said his son-in-law, Charles Grandison Finney Jr., who is the city's mayor. ""He did a lot of good for the city, and we're going to miss"
236;Joseph Smith was;"a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In 1842, he wrote a letter to his brother Hyrum asking him to come to Nauvoo, and that he would do his best to help him get there. He said that the Church had ""gone astray from the principles of the Gospel,"" and that ""there is no power but in God to save the dead, and the Lord is the only way to obtain eternal life."" (History of the Church, 1:39–40.) Joseph Smith's death on April 6, 1844, was the last of the martyrs to die in the Prophet's lifetime. He was buried in Carthage Jail, and his body was exhumed in 1847 to make a public display of his body. The Saints were shocked to learn that Joseph had been dead for more than a year and a half, and that he had suffered a stroke and died of natural causes. (See History of the Church,"
237;Summarize the goals of the Know Nothings.;What is the difference between the Nothings and the Cult of the Damned? The Know Nothings are a group of renegade cultists who seek to destroy the world, but their goal is not the destruction of the world, but the creation of a new world that will be ruled by their god, Tzeentch. The Cult of the Damned, on the other hand, is an ancient and powerful cult dedicated to the worship of the Old Ones, the gods of the Old Ones' world and the source of all life on the planet. The two groups have a lot in common, such as their belief in the primacy of the Old Ones, their hatred of the other races and the fact that they are willing to sacrifice their own kind in order to achieve their goals. Why did you decide to write a book about the cults of Tzeentch? I was fascinated by the idea of a world where the gods are worship
238;What religious denominations increased their influence in the United States during the Second Great Awakening?;Religious denominations in the United States experienced a rise in their influence from 1820 to 1850, but this did not translate into an increase in membership. The number of Americans who identified as Christian increased from 1.5 million in 1820 to 2.5 million in 1850, but there was no increase in the number of Christians in the United States. In fact, the number of Christians in the United States declined from 2.5 million in 1850 to 1.5 million in 1860 (see Figure 1). Figure 1. Percentage of Americans Who Identify as Christian, 1850-1860 Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Religious Congregations and Membership Study (RCMS), 1850-1860. What religious denominations declined in influence during the Second Great Awakening? The decline in the influence of religious denominations was most pronounced in the North and Midwest, where Protestantism was the dominant religion for much of the 20th century. In the South,
239;How did the writers of the early to mid-1800s reflect American life?;It's hard to say because we're talking about a time before the Civil War, when there was no social class or racial hierarchy. The people who wrote about the frontier were the first to think about what it meant to be a man or a woman, and that was reflected in the stories they wrote. They had a lot of fun with that, and I think that's one of the things that makes them so interesting to us today. How did the frontier have an impact on your writing? Well, it did, in a way. When I was growing up in the '30s and '40s, my father was a railroad engineer and I went to school with him. He'd tell me stories about the railroad that were so good that they made me want to be an engineer. And that kind of inspired me as a young writer and made me want to write a book about that time and the people who lived in the frontier. What was it
240;Imagine you are an Irish or German immigrant in the mid-1800s. Write an essay contrasting the United States with your homeland.;"What would you say to the American who said, ""I don't want to live in a country where people are afraid to speak their minds, where the government has the power to shut down a newspaper or censor a book, where I can go to jail for saying the wrong thing and get a life sentence if I'm caught?"" You might have a hard time getting your point across, but that's the point. If you can't do that, it's time to think about moving to another country. The problem with immigration is that it's a two-way street. The people who immigrate to the United States are the same people who come from other countries, and that creates a lot of resentment among those who have been here a long time. In a recent survey, Americans were asked to name the most important reason for immigration, and immigration came in at No. 1. It's no surprise that immigration is the number one issue on the minds of Americans these"

Contents show] Biography Edit Early life Edit Dorothea Dix was born in 1609.[1] Her father, the Lord of Casterly Rock, was a nobleman of the Dornish House Hightower, and her mother, the Lady Elisabeth, was a noblewoman of the House Baratheon. The two of them had a son, Dorothea, who was the heir to the throne of Westeros after the death of his father in 1610.[2] At some point in her life, Dorothea became an apprentice to the maester Aemon the Dragonknight, who taught her the ways of the Night's Watch and how to fight in the wildlings' war against the Boltons. She was trained as a squire and eventually took the name ""Lorelei"" for her skill with a sword and the ability to read the minds"
242;Lyman Beecher was;a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from New York. He died of a heart attack on March 31, 2017 at the age of 90. The following is a statement from his family: We are grateful for the outpouring of love and support we have received from so many people, and especially from President Trump, who has been a friend and supporter of our family for many years. Our family would like to thank all the doctors, nurses, and nurses-in-training who have worked to care for Mr. Beecher, and to our family for their unwavering love and support. We ask that you respect our privacy during this difficult time. In the past few days, the media has focused on the health problems that have beset the Trump White House and its staff, but it is important to remember that this is a family that has been through so much in the past, and that the president's words and actions are the same as those
243;Horace Mann was;a member of the New York Society for Psychical Research (SPSR). Mann's research on psychic phenomena began in 1882 when he began to use hypnosis as a means of gaining information about the minds of people who were suffering from mental illness. In the 1890s and early 1900s, the SPSR became a leader in the field of psychical research, publishing a number of books and pamphlets that dealt with the paranormal and other phenomena. During World War I, Mann was an assistant to Dr. J. P. Morgan, the head of Standard Oil of New Jersey. In 1919, Mann became a full professor at Columbia University in New York City and continued to teach until his death in 1947. In addition to his work with the SPSR, Mann was the author of several books, including The Man Who Knew Too Much (1925), A Study of Man (1926), and the first book in the field of the Paran
244;Elizabeth Cady Stanton was;born in 1848. Her father, a lawyer, was one of the founders of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), which advocated temperance as a means of combating the evils of alcohol and other intoxicants. Stanton became involved in the suffrage movement in New York and was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1868. She served as a member of the House Committee on the Status of Women and was the first woman to hold a cabinet position in the United States. Her efforts to improve women's rights led to the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920, which granted women the right to vote. After her election to the House, Stanton began a campaign for the Democratic nomination for Vice President in 1872, but lost to Thomas Dewey of New York by a margin of 1,721 votes. In 1876, Stanton ran for the Senate in a rematch against Dewey, this time
245;State the main goal of the early women’s movement.;"In 1848, the New York Times ran a front-page story headlined ""The Birth of a Nation."" The article reported that a group of ""free and emancipated women"" had gathered in the town of Natchez, Mississippi, to plan a march to Washington, D.C. They were led by Harriet Tubman, who would become the first African-American to hold the White House. The march was called ""The March for Freedom,"" and its goal was to ""abolish slavery and establish a government of the people, by the people, and for the people."" Tubman's role in the march was significant, not only because of her race, but also because she was one of the most prominent women in the United States at the time. In addition to being a suffragist, she was an abolitionist, and she led a group of about 100 women from her home state of North Carolina to the South in 1848. The group traveled"
246;How did the Second Great Awakening affect the reform movements of the mid-1800s?;A number of factors played a role in the growth of reform movements, including the fact that there was a large number of people who felt that their religion was under attack, and that the religious leaders were not doing enough to defend their faith. In addition, many of the reform movements were based on an individualistic, anti-authoritarian approach to religion, which tended to be a rejection of the authority of the church and a belief in the right of individuals to make their own decisions about their faith. This is not to say that these movements were without merit, but they were not the dominant force in the early twentieth century. What was the role of the Church of England in the Second Great Awakening? The Church of England was the most important institution in the movement, and it did a great deal to promote the ideas of the Second Great Awakening. For example, the Anglican Communion had a strong presence in the United States during the first half of the century, and
247;In what ways did the new penitentiaries change the prison system?;It was a big change for the inmates. They were in a place where they could get out of their cells at any time, and that was a big change from the old system, where they had to be in their cells 24 hours a day. The prison system has changed a lot since that time, and I think there are a lot of things that have been done to make it more humane and less punitive. What are some of the most common misconceptions about solitary confinement? People think it's for people who have mental illness, but that's not the case. It's used to lock people up for long periods of time, and they're not doing anything wrong. The vast majority of people who are in solitary are nonviolent offenders, and they're not hurting anyone. How do you respond to critics who say solitary confinement is a form of torture? I'm not going to get into that, because it's a personal opinion. But what I will

249;American Colonization Society was;"a non-profit organization founded in 1848 to promote the interests of African Americans in the United States. The organization had its origins in the Civil War, when the U.S. government attempted to emancipate slaves who had fought in the war. In order to do so, the federal government needed to determine who was a slave and who was not. This was a difficult task because of the lack of documentation on the slave population at the time, which made it difficult to determine which slaves were free and which were not. As a result, the U.S. government decided to set up a system of ""certificates of emancipation"" that would be given to those who were freed by the end of the Civil War. These certificates were used to determine whether or not a slave was free, and if so, how much he or she would be paid for his or her freedom. After the Civil War, slavery was abolished in the United States, but not"
250;William Lloyd Garrison was;a well-known anti-Semite and the founder of the Ku Klux Klan. Garrison's Klan, which grew out of the Reconstruction-era American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), was responsible for lynching African Americans in the South and other acts of violence against the black community. The Klan had a long history of terrorizing black Americans, and in 1882, a Klan member shot and killed a black man in New York City's Central Park. After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865, President Ulysses S. Grant issued Executive Order 9066, which banned the Klan from the United States. However, this ban did not apply to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which continued to operate as a legal entity under the auspices of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). This was the first time in American history that a civil rights organization was banned by the federal government. The SCLC's
251;American Antislavery Society was;"founded in 1832 by John C. Calhoun, a slaveholder who served as president of the U.S. Senate from 1832 to 1836. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)'s Hatewatch has documented a number of anti-LGBT incidents in the past few years, including a hate crime that took place in June of this year at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The victim, a transgender woman, was beaten with a tire iron and set on fire by a group of men who called her a ""faggot"" and said she should be ""burned at the stake."" In addition to the SPLC, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) is a civil rights organization that advocates for LGBT rights. HRC has a long history of working to end discrimination against LGBT people and their family members, as well as the right to marry, adopt, and be treated equally under the law.

I'm from a family that has been involved in the civil rights movement since the 1960s. My great-grandfather was a slave owner and my great-grandfather fought for the right to own property in the United States. We were part of the Underground Railroad, so it's a part of our family history that is very important to me. Tell us about your childhood. How did you get involved in the civil rights movement? Growing up, I was a little different than most kids my age. I had a lot of friends who were black, but I was the only African American in my school. My parents were in the South, so we had to go to church every Sunday and pray for the future of our country. I remember one of my friends, an English teacher, saying, ""You know, if you want to be a lawyer, you have to learn the Bible."" And I"
253;Which individuals helped build support for abolition, and what did they do to win that support?;"A lot of people were working in the slave trade, for example. There were abolitionists in New York, in Boston, in Philadelphia—all over the country. But the most important person to get the ball rolling was William Lloyd Garrison, who founded the Anti-Slavery Society in 1832. The Society was a sort of umbrella organization for abolitionists, and it had its own newspaper, The Liberator, as well as a weekly magazine called The Call. Garrison was an eloquent speaker, and he used his pulpit to spread the word about the evils of slavery. In the 1840s, he wrote a series of pamphlets that became known as the ""Garrison Lectures,"" in which he argued persuasively that slavery was a moral and legal abomination and should be abolished. The lecture series was published in pamphlet form, and they went on to sell millions of copies. What was Garrison's impact on the abolition movement? Garrison played a"
254;Why is William Lloyd Garrison’s publication of the Liberator considered a turning point in the abolitionist movement?;"Garrison, a slaveholder, was one of the most influential abolitionists of the 19th century. In 1832, he founded the Free Soil Party, which advocated the return of slavery to the United States as a ""natural institution."" The party won a plurality of state and federal elections in 1832, and Garrison became the first president of the newly formed Republican Party (later known as the Whig Party). In 1836, he ran for president as a Whig, but lost to Millard Fillmore, an anti-slavery Democrat. Garrison continued to write, and his writings helped popularize the idea of a free labor movement and abolitionist ideas. What is the significance of Garrison's publication of the Liberator? The publication of the Liberator marked the beginning of the end of slavery in the United States. It was an important step in the fight to emancipate African Americans, who were considered second-class citizens in the United States"
255;In which states did the percentage of African American population decrease by at least 5 percent between1820 and 1860?;Click here to find out the answer to this question and many more in our state-by-state data visualizations. Data Sources and Methodology We used U.S. Census Bureau data to identify the states and the District of Columbia that had the largest percentage of African American population in 1860. This was done by dividing the number of slaves in each state by the total population, which is equal to the sum of the population of the 50 states plus the District of Columbia. We then used the percentage of African Americans as a proxy for the size of the slave population in each state and the District of Columbia. For example, if there were 1,000,000 slaves in the United States in 1860, the percentage of African Americans in the state would be 1.00, and the percentage of slaves in the District of Columbia would be 0.00. This gives us a state-by-state breakdown of the percentage of African Americans in each state and the

259;John Deere was;"the first to use the term ""hybrid"" in its marketing. The company has a history of marketing to women, and in recent years has focused on the needs of older women who are looking for a vehicle that can be driven on the road, not just in the garage. ""We're trying to get women to think about the vehicle as a tool,"" said Deere vice president of marketing and public relations John Clements. ""It's not an afterthought, it's part of the toolkit."" Hybrid vehicles are designed to meet a variety of needs, such as those of people with disabilities, seniors and the handicapped, according to the company. The vehicle has a four-cylinder engine, which makes it easier to get around town and to places where there are no roads, Clements said. And it has an automatic transmission, which allows drivers to change gears without having to pull over to the side of the road. """

262;Kit Carson was;"one of the most prolific writers of the 20th century. Carson's books are filled with a wealth of information about the human condition, and they have helped shape the way we think about mental illness and its treatment. In addition to the book, Carson wrote a number of articles for medical and scientific journals, as well as a book, The Autobiography of Dr. Seuss (1962). The following is a list of Carson's most famous works, in alphabetical order by author. 1. How to Win Friends and Influence People by Carol Dweck, published in 1962. This book was the first in a series of books that Carson would write in the years to come. The title comes from a line in the book: ""How to get along with people is like walking on eggshells; you never know what they're going to say, or how they're going to react to your every utterance."" 2.

263;Jim Bridger was;"one of the most successful actors of his generation. Bridger's career spanned the 1960s and 1970s, from The Blues Brothers to Pulp Fiction, and was a staple of Hollywood blockbusters for decades to come. But in recent years, the actor has been on the outs with the studio system, which he blames for his declining health. ""I think it's a combination of things,"" Bridger told Entertainment Weekly last year. ""The studios are trying to make movies that are cheap to make, and that's not my cup of tea. I like to be paid for my work, and I'm not going to give up that for a couple of bucks a picture."" He added, ""I've had a lot of heart attacks, and they keep me on blood thinners and all that kind of stuff. But I'm doing fine, thank you very much.""

264;Donner Party was;"the first to use the term ""socialism"" in its campaign. It's a term that has been in vogue for a long time, but the word itself is an oxymoron. Socialism means government ownership of the means of production, and that's the point at which we're talking about a socialist state. It's not about the distribution of wealth, as some have tried to make it out to be. In the United States, there are two kinds of socialism: one based on private property and the other on public ownership. The former is what we have in the Soviet Union, and the latter is what we have in most of the countries that have been socialistized since the 1960s and 1970s. Socialism, by definition, is the state taking over the means of production and redistributing the wealth that it produces to the people who work in those factories and those offices and so on. That's socialism. But what's wrong with"

But I am not an expert on the history of the Church, nor do I have the time to read every book that comes to my attention.

267;What two inventions made it easier to farm the frontier?;Inventors and their inventions are the foundation of a nation's economic growth, and it's no coincidence that the United States has one of the most productive inventors per capita in the world. But what two inventions made it easier to farm the frontier? One was the steam engine, which allowed farmers to move from place to place with less risk of losing their crops, and the other was the cotton gin, which allowed the cotton industry to be more efficient and less vulnerable to disease. Both of these inventions helped create the American middle class, which was a key factor in the country's economic growth in the 19th century. The invention of the steamship in the 1820s and 1830s was an important step in the development of the U.S. economy. The first transoceanic steamship, the Columbia, arrived in New York in 1820 with a cargo of 2,000 tons of cotton, but was unable to make it across the Atlantic because
268;How did the United States settle its land disputes with Great Britain and the Plains Indians?;"It was a combination of military force and diplomacy that led to the creation of the United States of America in 1776. The British were in the process of colonizing the New World, and they needed to be dealt with militarily. In 1775, the Continental Congress passed a resolution calling for the ""abolition of the Indian trade and the establishment of a free trade in the West Indies."" This was an attempt to end the Indian trade and free the West Indies from British control. The resolution went unheeded, however, and the British continued to colonize the New World. By 1776, there were more than a million Indians in the Americas, making them the largest population in the world at that time. What is the relationship between the Native Americans and the European settlers? The relationship between the Native Americans and the European settlers was one of mutual respect and a shared desire to live in peace and harmony. However, as time went on, tensions began to grow"

270;National Colonization Act was;the first of its kind in the U.S. and set the stage for the creation of the Federal Reserve. In 1867, the United States became the first nation to issue its own currency, the Greenback. It was a success, but not without controversy. The Greenback was backed by gold, which made it vulnerable to devaluation, as did the dollar's role as the world's reserve currency. As inflation became a problem, President Andrew Jackson signed the Tariff of Abominations in 1867, which imposed tariffs on imports and foreign-exchange reserves to pay for the war against Mexico. This led to a sharp drop in the value of the dollar, which in turn led to an inflationary spiral that lasted until the Civil War. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Federal Reserve began to play a central role in stabilizing the economy. In the early 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt instituted the New Deal, which aimed to create

272;Antonio López de Santa Anna was;"a member of the military junta that ruled the country from 1932 to 1939. In his memoirs, he describes the ""exhaustion of the military, the lack of food and medical supplies, the destruction of the country by fire and the starvation of the civilian population"" as a result of the civil war.

273;Sam Houston was;one of the most prolific scorers in the history of the NBA. He averaged 30.8 points per game in his rookie season, and his scoring average would rise to 35.3 the following season before a knee injury ended his career. The Houston Rockets have a lot of talent on their roster, but it's hard to find a player who can be the focal point of a team like the Rockets. That's why we're going to focus on one player in this article, and that player is none other than Patrick Beverley. Beverley is a 6'9 forward who plays with a chip on his shoulder and an unbridled desire to prove his doubters wrong. He's not afraid to take on the toughest opponent in the league, and he does it by putting up big numbers on the defensive end of the floor. In 2014-15, Beverley led the NBA in blocked shots (1,621), and he finished second in defensive win
274;Alamo was;"a good example of the ""old guard"" that had to be brought into the party. In the 1960s and 1970s, the party was dominated by men who did not have the experience of running a business, and were not in the business world at all. They were the ones who had been in the military or the intelligence services, and had no experience in the private sector. And that was a problem for the party, because it needed to appeal to a broad range of people, not just the business class. So what happened was that, over the course of the next 30 years, there was a transformation of the party from a party of the working class to a party of Wall Street, the military-industrial complex, and big business. And the result was that the party lost its ability to win elections, and became the party of corporate America.

276;Explain why Texas declared war on Mexico.;The answer is simple: Mexico is a sovereign nation with its own laws and borders. Texas, on the other hand, is part of the United States of America, and its laws apply to all of the United States. If you want to fight a war, you have to go to war with the people who live in your country, not with the people who live in another country. That's the way it is in the United States of America. What's your favorite part of the movie? I like the scene where the Texan is trying to get a gun out of his glove compartment and it goes off. That's a good scene. It's the kind of scene that makes you feel like you're in the movie, not watching it on TV. How many guns do you own? I have two guns, a Ruger 9mm and a Smith & Wesson M&P.40 S&W. The Ruger is for hunting

278;How did the Texan defeats at the Alamo and Goliad affect Texans?;It's hard to say for sure, but one thing is for sure: The Texans were a different team in 1836 than they were in 1836. They had no one to run with, no one to throw to, and their quarterback, Sam Houston, was an unheralded journeyman with a reputation for bad decisions. In a game that was won by a score of 24-0, Texas had to play from behind all day and was outscored in the second half by more than a score a game. The only thing that helped the Texans was the presence of the Mexican army, which kept them in the game until the last minute. What was the most memorable moment of the game? There are a few that stand out to me. First, the game-winning touchdown pass to George Preston Marshall, who would go on to play for the New York Giants and become one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. The play was a classic
279;Imagine that you are living in Texas in the late 1830s. Write a letter to the U.;"Imagine that you are living in Texas in the late 1830s. Write a letter to the U.S. Secretary of State asking for a loan of $10,000 to build a railroad across the state.

The letter would be addressed to ""Mr. President"" and would include a copy of the bill of lading, which is the document that shows the cargo of a ship that has left the port of New York and is headed for Texas.

In 1835, Congress passed the Tariff Act of 1835, which prohibited the importation of cotton from the United States, except for the purpose of making it into articles of commerce. This was a direct attack on the cotton industry in the United States and it had a devastating effect on the American economy. Cotton was the nation's most important export, and its price had skyrocketed to more than $100 per bushel in 1835. The tariff was so high that many farmers could not afford to buy their crops at market prices, and many were forced to sell their crops to pay the tariff.

In the years that followed, Tyler's career took him to the United States Naval Academy, where he graduated in 1942 with a bachelor's degree in political science and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. He spent the next four years at the academy, and after the war, he joined the Merchant Marine as a deckhand and worked his way up to the rank of ensign. Tyler returned to the United States in 1946 to take a job as a naval intelligence officer in San Diego, Calif. There, he met his wife, Mary, and the couple had a son, John Tyler Jr. (1946-1998).

Zachary shrugged a little. ""I'm not sure how it's going to go, but there's a lot of people who want to fight, and a lot of people who are willing to do it.

284;Bear Flag Republic was;"founded in 1885 by William F. ""Bill"" Lee, who served as president of the United States from 1901-1905. The flag has been a source of controversy for some time, but it's not the first time it's come under fire. A group of high school students in New York City, for example, created a flag that features a swastika on the top, and the school board banned it from flying in the auditorium. In the past, flag-burning has been associated with anti-Semites, white supremacists and neo-Nazis. But that's no longer the case, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups in the United States. ""We're seeing a shift in the public's perception of this kind of flag,"" Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC's Intelligence Project, told ABC News. ""People are starting to see it as a symbol of hate, and that's not what it's supposed"

The marriage was annulled by the Civil War, and Scott returned to his family farm. In 1869, Scott began teaching school at age 16, and by the time he was 18 he was the headmaster of an all-boys school in New York City. He continued to teach until his death in 1892.

286;Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was;signed in 1848 by the U.S. and Mexico to end the Mexican-American War. A few years later, Mexico declared war on the United States for the first time in its history. The war lasted from 1846 to 1848 and resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000 Americans and Mexican soldiers. During the war, the two countries fought a number of skirmishes, including the Battle of Puebla, in which Mexican troops were forced to retreat from the capital of Mexico City. In 1848, President James K. Polk signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the war in Mexico's favor. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo is one of the most important treaties in American history. It established the boundary between the United States and Mexico, as well as the boundaries of the states of Texas and New Mexico.

287;Summarize the controversy between Mexico and the United States over Texas.;What is the border dispute all about? In the 1980s, a group of U.S. ranchers, led by Cliven Bundy, refused to pay grazing fees to the federal government in an attempt to stop the construction of a highway through their ranch. The dispute became a cause célèbre for right-wing groups, who argued that the government was encroaching on private property and needed to be restrained in its use of force. Bundy and his supporters were arrested and charged with a range of crimes, including conspiracy to impede federal officers from carrying out their duties. In 1989, a federal judge found Bundy guilty of all charges, but he was sentenced to five years in prison and fined $1.1 million. Bundy appealed the verdict, and his appeal was heard by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which ruled in his favor in 2000. The Supreme Court denied review of the case in 2003, but a lower court had upheld

But there was another war in the Pacific, the Russo-Japanese War, which had a lot of potential to cause problems for the United States. The Japanese were trying to take over Manchuria, and they were threatening to do it in the South China Sea. So, it was a very dangerous situation, and the U.S. had to take a lot of precautions in order to protect its interests and its interests in the Far East.

294;Conscience Whigs was;the name of a group of anti-communist, right-wing Republicans who opposed the U.S. entry into World War II. In the 1950s, the name was changed to the American Conservative Union (ACU), an offshoot of the National Rifle Association (NRA). The NRA has a long history of using its power to influence elections, and it's no surprise that the ACU would try to do the same in the name of gun rights. But what is surprising is how much of a coincidence it is that this name change occurred at the same time that the NRA was lobbying for a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines — two items that are at the center of the NRA's agenda. As I wrote last year, there's a lot of evidence that the NRA has an interest in keeping guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens and in promoting the idea that guns are the best way to protect against crime. But that does

Cotton had a long history in the United States, dating back to the 1600s and 1750s. The first cotton gin was built in New York City in 1750 and by the early 1800s, there were over 1,000 cotton mills in the U.S. and Canada. Culturally, American cotton was an important part of the fabric of American life. It was woven into everything from the clothes we wore to the food we ate, and it was the foundation of the American economy. In addition to the economic value of cotton, it was a symbol of freedom and freedom from oppression. But as time went on, cotton began to lose its importance as a fabric of American life. It was no longer the fabric of our nation's economic and political life, and

Their platform included the abolition of slavery, land reform (a system of government-owned land for free-soilers) and an end to the ""welfare state"" that provided social services to the poor. The first government of the Free-Soilers was headed by William Lyon Mackenzie King, who had served as prime minister of Great Britain from 1867 to 1871.

297;“Forty-Niners.” was;"the name of a football team in Los Angeles, Calif. In 1887, the San Francisco 49ers became the first team to play in the Super Bowl. They lost to the New York Giants on February 3, 1887. On September 11, 2001, the Niners played the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game. The game was a nailbiter, with Arizona taking the lead in the fourth quarter, only to be outscored 24-0 in the final two quarters. Arizona's quarterback Kurt Warner was named the game's MVP. The team has won three Super Bowls, in 1960, 1971 and 2002. The name is pronounced ""FORT-ee-NIN-ers"" and comes from the Latin for ""football team,"" fortis. A number of people have suggested that the name could be a reference to the fort that was built on the site of the present-day Santa Clara University in the 1850s to house"
298;Summarize how Americans responded to the idea of popular sovereignty.;"What is the difference between a ""democracy"" and a ""republic""? In this section, we examine the historical and political development of the term ""democracy"" and how it has been used to describe the United States since the nation's founding. We then look at the current state of democracy in the United States, as well as what it means to be a citizen of the United States. Finally, we discuss the implications of this discussion for the future of American democracy. Historical Development of the Term ""Democracy"" The term ""democracy"" was first used in 18th century England and the United States as a synonym for ""rule of the people."" This is because the people were the source of power in the British and American republics, and the people could be relied upon to rule themselves. In other words, democracy was a form of government in which the people had the power to decide what laws to enact and how those laws should be enforced."
299;How did the war with Mexico and the Gold Rush affect the slavery issue in the United States?;It was a very difficult time for the slave trade. There were a lot of people who wanted to end it, but the political power of the South was such that they could not do it. It was not until 1833 that slavery was abolished in the U.S. by the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. That was the end of the war with Mexico and the gold rush. What was the impact of the Civil War on the abolitionist movement? The war had a huge impact on the anti-slavery movement. In the 1850s and 1860s, abolitionists were trying to get Congress to pass a law that would make it illegal for anyone to buy or sell a slave without the consent of the owner. That was a big issue for the abolitionists. They had a lot of pressure on their hands, and they wanted to make sure that Congress did not pass that law. The Civil War also gave people the opportunity to start thinking
300;Explaining Why did Zachary Taylor win the election of 1848?;Zachary Taylor was a man of many talents, but one of his most important was his eloquence. In his campaign for the U.S. Senate, he spoke with a voice that resonated with the people of his home state of New York, and his speeches were a major factor in his victory. The following is a list of his speeches and what they were about: 1. A Message to the People of New York, 1848 2. An Exposition of the State of New York, 1848 3. A Message to the People of the United States, 1848 4. A Reminiscence of the Life of John Quincy Adams, 1848 5. A Reminiscence of the Life of Thomas Jefferson, 1848 6. A Reminiscence of the Life of James Otis, 1848 7. A Reminiscence of the Life of George Wythe
301;What elements of the painting suggest the seriousness of the slavery issue being debated?;I think it's a painting of an African-American slave, a man who has been sold into slavery by his family and is trying to get his freedom. The fact that he's wearing a suit and tie makes him look like a professional, and that's what we want to be in the United States of America. But it's not a happy painting, in the sense that it's not happy to see people in slavery and suffering. It's sad to see that people are being treated like that, and that's the kind of painting that should be on the wall of every school in the country. How do you feel about the controversy that has surrounded the painting? I feel like it's an important issue to talk about, and I'm glad that people are paying attention to it. The problem is that people are making it about something that is not a big deal. It's not about slavery in any way, shape or form. It's about the treatment of
302;Imagine you are Henry Clay. Write a speech to present to the Senate.;"What would you say? Clay's speech is an example of what is known as ""colloquial speech,"" a form of speech that has its roots in Shakespeare's plays and is used to communicate a message to a wide audience. The word colloquial comes from the Latin colloquium, meaning ""group of people"" or ""council of people."" Clay's speech was written in 1820, but it was published in the New York Herald on April 1, 1820. The Herald, a newspaper in New York, published a series of letters from Clay, which were collected by his biographer, William Gaddis (1823-1910). Gaddis was a professor of English at Columbia University and an expert on Clay's speech. In his speech, Clay described the events of the Civil War as a ""battle of ideas"" between abolitionists and slaveholders. He argued that slavery was the cause of the war, and that the only"
303;Uncle Tom’s Cabin was;"a white supremacist, anti-Semite, Ku Klux Klan sympathizer. In the 1930s and 1940s, he ran for Congress in the District of Columbia, but lost to a Democrat. After World War II, he became a U.S. Army chaplain and served in the Korean War. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group, has called him a ""hate group leader"" and said he ""promotes white supremacy and neo-Nazism."" ""I'm proud to stand with my fellow patriots in the United States of America and say that this man is no longer welcome in our country,"" Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the House majority whip, said in a statement on Friday. Scalise's comments were the latest salvo in a debate over Trump's response to violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend. The president said there were ""very fine people"" on both"
304;Fugitive Slave Act was;"the first of its kind to have a criminal penalty for a slave who escaped. In 1833, the Fugitive Slave Act was amended to include African-Americans, who were considered ""persons of African descent"" under the law. This meant that any person in the United States who could prove that he or she was a slave or had been a slave at any time during the previous five years was subject to arrest and imprisonment, regardless of whether or not the person was convicted of a crime. A few years later, in 1844, President Andrew Johnson signed the Emancipation Proclamation, abolishing slavery in the United States. The Emancipation Proclamation did not, however, free all slaves in the U.S. and only freed a small number of slaves who had been held in slavery for more than a year. After the Civil War, slavery was re-legalized in the states that had seceded from the Union, and it"
305;Harriet Tubman was;"a slave. In 1852, the Supreme Court ruled that slavery was legal in the United States, a decision that sparked a wave of civil rights activism and helped pave the way for the Civil Rights Movement. But it's not just the history of slavery that is at stake in the case, but the future of black Americans as they move into the 21st century. A federal judge in New York is expected to rule this week on whether President Trump's travel ban will be allowed to go into effect. The ruling could have a major impact on the lives of people who have immigrated to the United States from Muslim-majority countries, and it could be the first time in more than 60 years that a court has struck down a ban on Muslims entering the country. ""This is a moment of reckoning,"" Abigail Thernstrom, a professor at Fordham Law School in New York, told NBC News. Thernstrom is one of the lawyers representing the"
306;Gadsden Purchase was;"the first of a series of military-style training exercises to take place in the United States. The exercise involved about 1,000 U.S. and South Korean troops, as well as hundreds of North Korean soldiers who were part of the training. In an interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson, Trump said he was ""sickened"" by the news, which he called ""a very, very sad day for our country."" ""We have a lot of killers. We have a lot of madmen in this world, but this is a very, very serious problem,"" the president said. ""It's a very, very sad day when you look at what's happening in our country and the world with North Korea. And I say this with great surety, and I say it with no doubt at all: The world is watching and we have to be very, very strong and very, very vigilant.""

307;Kansas-Nebraska Act was;a response to the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. It allows corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections without disclosing who is paying for the ads, as long as they do not coordinate with a candidate or political party. The law has been criticized by the American Civil Liberties Union as a violation of free speech and equal protection under the law. In 2012, McCrory signed a bill into law to ban same-sex marriage in North Carolina, but that was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in June. McCrory's campaign has been under investigation by the state Ethics Commission for more than a year, and a special prosecutor is looking into allegations that he misused campaign funds to pay for legal fees related to the investigation. ___ Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.
308;Charles Sumner was;"a member of the U.S. Senate from New York. He served as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and was the first President of the United States to attend the Constitutional Convention. In 1801, Sumner wrote a letter to James Madison, asking him to consider the possibility of a national bank. The following year, Sumner became an outspoken advocate of the Federal Reserve System as a way to stabilize the currency and prevent hyperinflation. ""I have no doubt that the bank of the United States will be of service to the country in a great measure, and it is my opinion that a national bank, with all its advantages, will be the most effectual means of promoting the prosperity of the country,"" Sumner wrote in 1801. In 1804, Sumner was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, along with Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and others. The Declaration of Independence"
309;Explain how the transcontinental railroad intensified the slavery issue.;What was the role of the United States in the transcontinental railroad, and how did it contribute to the spread of slavery? In 1869, Congress passed the Homestead Act, which provided for the purchase of land in the West to be used as homesteads for free blacks. This was a major step in the emancipation of African Americans, and it helped create the conditions for the slave trade to become a major source of revenue for the U.S. government. The Homestead Act, however, did not apply to the South, which was the only part of the country with a population of more than one million at the time. This meant that, as a result of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, the federal government could no longer confiscate slaves from slave owners who fled to the South to escape the law. In addition, the Fugitive Slave Act had been amended several times since its passage, most recently in 1868, to make it easier for fugitive slaves
310;How did antislavery activists justify disobeying the Fugitive Slave Act?;"It's hard to know what they were thinking at the time, but the abolitionists had a number of reasons for doing so. One was that slavery was a ""cruel and inhumane institution,"" according to a New York Times editorial in 1833. ""It is the most atrocious of all the abominations that the human mind can conceive,"" the editorial continued. ""No man has a right to enslave another, and no man has a right to take a slave from his master without his consent."" In other words, the idea that slaves were property was anathema to the anti-slavery movement. And as long as slavery was legal, there was no reason to disobey the law. Another reason for breaking the Fugitive Slave Act was to help African-Americans escape the violence of slavery. The law had been in effect since 1790, but it was rarely enforced. In the 1830s, for example, only a handful of slave"
311;What events led to “Bleeding Kansas”?;"I was in my mid-20s when I started this project. The idea came to me in the summer of 2011, and I had a lot of time to do it. It was an interesting time in my life, and I wanted to document what was going on in Kansas and the rest of the United States at that time. How did you get started? My friend and I went to a bar one night and had a few beers. We talked about how much we loved music, and he told me about this band called Bleeding Kansas. They were playing in the Kansas City area, and I thought it would be cool to meet them. So that's how it started. What's the story behind the band name? The band name is a play on the word ""blood"" and ""kansas,"" which is the state of Kansas. It's an allusion to the fact that the band has a lot of blood in their music and"
312;Imagine you are a reporter for a Southern or Northern newspaper in the 1850s. Write an article on public reaction to Uncle Tom’s Cabin.;"What is the most interesting thing you learned about the movie? A lot of people were surprised to learn that it was a slave movie at the time. I had no idea, but the fact that so many people didn't know was a sign of how far we had come in terms of civil rights. It was an important movie to show the movie industry that there was a market for this kind of movie. How did you get involved with the production and what was the process like? My wife and I were living in New York at the time and I went to the movie theater one night to see Uncle Tom's Cabin. The theater was packed with people, and I was standing in the back, looking at the movie and thinking, ""This is going to be a great movie."" So I called a friend of mine who was an assistant to the studio and asked if he could help me with the publicity. He said, ""Sure, why not?"" And I was on"

314;Dred Scott was;"a slave. It's time to stop talking about slavery and start talking about human rights. We have the right to be free, but we need to do more than that. The abolition of slavery was a step in the right direction, but there is much more to be done. In this week's episode of Unheard, we speak with Dr. James McPherson, a professor of political science at Texas A&M University who specializes in race and the United States. McPherson's research has shown that African Americans are less likely than whites to have a college degree, which is the foundation of economic success. In addition, black children born into low-income families are more likely to live in poverty than white children. This has a direct impact on their health and well-being, and it's one of the most important factors contributing to the racial disparities in health that exist today.

315;Lecompton constitution was;"the first to recognize the right to self-defense. In 1864, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that states had the right to keep and bear arms, a decision that set the stage for the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. But that was not the end of the battle for gun rights. After the Civil War, a series of court decisions, including Dred Scott v. Sandford in 1857, established that African-Americans were not citizens and could not be denied the right to vote. In the decades that followed, the right to bear arms became a litmus test for who was a ""legitimate target"" for government action. As a result, many states passed laws restricting the ownership of firearms and requiring background checks for gun purchasers. ""There was a lot of fear and loathing,"" said David Kopel, a professor of political science at George Washington University who specializes in gun policy. ""People felt that"
316;Freeport Doctrine was;"a military doctrine of the United States that sought to protect U.S. interests by deterring other nations from engaging in aggression. The doctrine was adopted in the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.[1] Contents show] History Edit Early History Edit ""You know, I'm going to have to get a job in the White House. And that's a good thing, because the President of the United States is a man of his word."" ―Mackenzie McHale [src] The concept of the ""Protocols of the Elders of Zion"" was first proposed by President John F. Kennedy on September 11, 1963 in a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the pro-Israel lobby. Kennedy's speech called for the United States to ""stand with Israel in its hour of need"" and for the United States to be ""the most powerful force for peace in the Middle East.""[2]"
317;List the two rulings in Dred Scott v. Sandford that increased sectional divisiveness.;"The first was a decision by the Supreme Court of South Carolina in 1857 that said blacks could no longer be slaves, but only ""persons of African descent."" This was followed by an even more radical decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1857, which said the Fourteenth Amendment did not apply to blacks in the states that had ratified the 14th Amendment. In other words, black people were no longer free, but only people of African descent. These decisions created a situation in which slavery was legal in all the states, but only in a few of them—Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. The South Carolina decision was the first of its kind, and set the stage for the Civil War. The second ruling was the Dred Scott decision of 1857, which said that blacks had no rights under the U.S. Constitution. This decision was a direct result of the 1857 decision in"
318;What were the main goals of the Republican and American Parties?;I think the main goal of the Republican Party was to win the White House in the next four years. That was the goal that they set out to achieve and it was a very, very difficult goal to achieve. The Democrats, on the other hand, were trying to achieve something that had never been achieved before in American history, which was a coalition of the middle class and the working class that had the ability to elect a president and a congressional majority in the United States of America. And that was the goal that they set out to achieve as well. What is the relationship between the two parties today? The relationship between the two parties is a very good relationship. There are a lot of people who have been in the Republican Party for a long time and are very loyal to the Republican Party. But there are also a lot of people who have been in the Democratic Party for a long time and are very loyal to the Democratic Party. And that's what makes it so
319;How did Americans react to John Brown’s raid?;"In 1859, the United States was at war with Great Britain. On April 2, Brown and his men raided Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina to protest the treatment of African Americans in the U.S. military. The raid was a success, and Brown was hanged for his actions. But Americans were not happy with the raid. Some of their most famous quotes include: ""I have a right to be angry, but it is the duty of the angry to be civil."" — Martin Luther King, Jr. ""The Negro is the most unfortunate of all races in this country. He suffers from the most inhumane treatment at the hands of the white man, and the only remedy is to get rid of him as a race."" — Theodore Roosevelt ""If you want to know what America is about, look at the color of her skin and the language she uses to describe her fellow man."" — Abraham Lincoln What is the difference"
320;Did any parties besides the Republican and Democratic survive after1865? How does this support the idea that the 1850s and 1860s were an important transition era in the nation’s history?;I'm going to take a stab at answering this question in two parts. First, let's look at the period from 1855 to 1865. This is the period that is most associated with the Civil War, but it was a very different time than the war itself. In fact, there were no battles of any kind between the North and the South during this period. The South was in the throes of a civil war that lasted from 1855 to 1856, when President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation to emancipate slaves in the United States. This was followed by the election of 1856, which was a landslide victory for the Republican Party, and the end of the Reconstruction Era (1861-1865). The Republicans won every state in the South except for the Carolinas, and they were able to do this by appealing to a wide swath of voters who felt disenfranchised by the Democratic Party and its policies. This was a time when

Write a letter to the editor explaining your reaction to the decision.;If you are a member of the media, send your letter to the editorial board of The Washington Post, which will publish it in the next week or so. The Post has a long history of supporting civil rights, and you can help make that history a reality by contributing to its fund-raising campaign. If you are an elected official, write your state representative and ask him or her to introduce a bill in your state that would ban discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), sexual orientation, gender dysphoria, or disability in employment, housing, public accommodations, and other areas of public life. The bill should be introduced by a member of your state legislature, and it should have at least 50 co-sponsors. If you are a business owner, contact your state's attorney general and ask him or her to investigate the business practices of your employer, and if necessary take legal action against the company.

324;Crittenden’s Compromise was;a major step in the right direction. But it's not enough to make up for the lack of support from the public, which continues to be the most important factor in the government's decision-making. In the past, governments have relied on public opinion to get their way, but that's no longer the case. The majority of Canadians want a more open and transparent government, not less. It's time for Stephen Harper to get on board with that change of heart. He's the prime minister of the 21st century, not the 20th century.
325;Jefferson Davis was;"a slave. In 1838, he wrote a letter to his brother-in-law, William Tompkins, asking for a share of his property. Tompkins replied that he would be willing to sell Davis to the United States, but only if Davis agreed to leave the South. The two men met on the banks of the Potomac in Washington, D.C., and negotiated a deal that would have freed Davis from slavery in exchange for $1,000 in gold, which was to be split between the two men. Davis refused to leave, and in 1839, a group of abolitionists led by Harriet Tubman stormed the White House and took Davis into custody. Tubman, along with her sister Abigail, became the first African-American to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. Tulane University's history of the Civil War, written by a professor of African-American studies, notes that ""the"

327;How did Lincoln prevent Kentucky, Missouri, and Maryland from seceding? Was Lincoln justified in his actions? Why or why not?;"Lincoln did not have the power to prevent secession, but he did have the power to make it a crime. In the words of the Supreme Court, ""The Constitution of the United States provides that no state shall secede from the Union without the consent of Congress."" This is a very important point to keep in mind when we look at Lincoln's actions and what they tell us about the nature of the Union as a whole. The first thing to note is that, according to the Constitution, Congress is the ""Legislative Branch"" of the federal government. The other branches, the executive and judicial, are ""Executive and Judicial Departments,"" respectively. This means that the powers of the President and the Vice President are divided between the two branches of government. In other words, the President has the power to declare war, but he does not have the power to initiate a state of war. The President does, however, have the power to call out the National Guard"
328;Why did Virginia’s secession surprise Northerners?;In 1859, Virginia was one of the most prosperous states in the Union. It had a population of more than 2 million, and the capital, Richmond, was home to more than a quarter of the state's population. But by the end of the Civil War, Virginia had fallen on hard times, and its economy was in shambles. In the years that followed, the state lost more than one-third of its population to emigration, and it became a center of labor unrest and the slave trade. As a result, many Virginians felt a sense of betrayal, and they voted to secede from the Union in 1861. The vote was a resounding victory for the anti-slavery cause, and it helped set the stage for the Civil War. What was the reaction of Virginia's secessionists? Southerners were shocked by the vote, and many of them took to the streets to protest. But they did not have
329;Imagine you are an adviser to President Lincoln, and you have just heard about the firing on Fort Sumter. Write a brief report for the president, advising him on what steps to take next.;The president will want to know: How do you know this is the right thing to do? What evidence do you have that it is the right thing to do? If you are a member of Congress, you can use your power of the purse to make sure the president does not fire the commander in chief for reasons other than the one you gave him. Congress has the power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, which is the process by which the president is required to carry out his duties. The president can use this power to prevent the president from acting in a way that Congress disapproves of—such as ordering the military to take over the fort, as Lincoln did in the Civil War. In other words, Congress can stop the president from doing what he wants to do, and it can do it by a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress. This is called the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, and it was written by James Madison
330;Robert E. Lee was;a slave owner. In 1866, the Supreme Court ruled that slavery was legal in the United States, and Lee's slave, Mary Crenshaw, was given the right to sue for her freedom. Crenshaw, who was the daughter of a freed slave, argued that she had been sold into servitude and should be able to reclaim her freedom. The case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in her favor. But that's not the end of the story. In a move that would have been unthinkable a century ago, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law on March 1, 1964. The law outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and sexual orientation), national origin, age, disability, genetic information, marital status, political affiliation, veteran status, and source of income. It was one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation in American history

Slidell was born in 1884 in Staunton, Virginia, the son of a lawyer and a homemaker. After graduating from high school, he went to work for the U.S. Bureau of Mines, where he became a geologist and mineralogist.

After several months of searching, the Acolytes were unable to find any sign of life, and decided to abandon the mission. However, a year later, in 2155, an asteroid was discovered in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and was named ""Jupiter's Asteroid Belt"", in honor of Jupiter, the Roman god of the sky.[2] This asteroid was discovered to have a similar composition to that of Apophis, but it was not known"

337;How did a belief in states’ rights hamper the South during the war?;"It is difficult to say that the South did not suffer at the hands of the Union, but there are a number of reasons for this. First, many Southerners were reluctant to take up arms for the Union cause because of their belief in states rights. This was a major factor in the Civil War and is one of the reasons why Southern states fought so hard to keep slavery in the Union. Second, the South had an inferiority complex that made it difficult for its citizens to accept the idea that they were inferior to other citizens in the Union. This inferiority complex was exacerbated by the fact that the South was a slave state, and it was not until 1877 that the Supreme Court ruled that slavery was a violation of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This decision, along with the 1876 Dred Scott decision, created a situation in which the South could no longer claim that it was the ""peculiar institution"" of the United States and therefore"

339;Why did the South resort to using paper money during the war?;"It was to keep the war from ending in a stalemate and prevent the United States from losing its ability to print money, which would have led to a devaluation of the dollar. In other words, they were trying to make it harder for the U.S. to pay for its war effort. How many dollars were in circulation at the end of the war? There were a total of $1.5 trillion in U.S. currency, according to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP). That's more than the value of all the gold in the world. What was the purpose of the paper money? The purpose was twofold: One, it was a way to keep the government in the black; and two, it was an alternative to the gold standard, which was the currency of the world at the time. Why did the South use paper money? The South had a lot of problems"

Write a letter to a relative explaining why you are planning on joining either the Union or Confederate army.;The letter should be short and to the point, so that it does not take long to get to your relative, or you may have to go to great lengths to do so. If you are in the South, you will need to find a way to get across the border without being caught by border patrol agents. The best way to do this is to take a boat to the other side of the border, which is a long and arduous journey with no guarantee of safety.

In 1864, Grant's army of 1,200,000 marched into the Shenandoah Valley, which was home to a population of more than 100,000. The Union army was in disarray, with no idea what to do with the thousands of Confederate soldiers who had fled across the Potomac River to avoid being captured by Grant's army. After a series of skirmishes, Grant decided to launch a full-scale attack on the Confederate capital of Richmond and its surrounding area. He had a plan: capture the city by the end of the month, which would be followed by a siege of the city by the end of the next month. On April 9, 1864, General Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the Union army in the Shenandoah Valley, ordered his troops to ""surrender or die"" in the face of a Confederate counterattack."

In 1882, President Grover Cleveland signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which abolished slavery in the United States. The proclamation did not, however, end the enslavement of African-Americans, who were still subject to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and the Civil Rights Act of 1866. On April 12, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, abolishing slavery in the United States. This amendment, along with the Fifteenth, Fourteenth, Seventeenth, and Twenty-eighth Amendments, established the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clauses. The Thirteenth Amendment was ratified by the states on December 15, 1865, and became part of the Constitution on January 1, 1868. In 1868, a group of Southern states formed the Ku Klux Klan

350;What made these vessels superior to regular warships used by the Union and the Confederacy?;A few factors were at work in the design of the vessels, including the use of steel in construction rather than iron, which was more expensive to produce and had a shorter life span. Also, they were designed to withstand the rigors of combat, and the Confederacy had no problem with this as it did not rely on ships for transport of troops, food, or other supplies. In addition, Confederate naval officers were well versed in the technology of the day, and knew how to use it to their advantage. For example, one Confederate admiral, William T. Sherman, was a master of the steam-powered battleship, the Virginia, and had a reputation for commanding the most powerful ships in the Confederate Navy. What was the difference between the Union and Confederate navies? The two navies were divided into two branches, the Navy and the Army.

The militia was to serve as a bulwark against the encroachment of the federal government on the rights of the people and to protect the state and its citizens in time of war. In addition to its role in the defense of the state, the militia was charged with the duty of maintaining order in the city, a task that would be carried out by the police force.

Sewage is the waste that goes into drains, sewers, storm drains, and water mains. It can be anything from animal excrement to human faeces, but the most common types of sewage are sewage sludge (sewage), rainwater, and industrial effluents such as oil, grease, and diesel fuel. In the United States, sewage accounts for more than half of all waterborne illnesses, including diarrhoea, cholera, typhoid fever, dysentery, and hepatitis. How does sanitation work? When people are sick, they need to be treated for their illness in a hospital or health care facility. This is called ""treatment,"" and it involves taking a patient's urine,"

357;State the two factors that contributed to a food shortage in the South during the Civil War.;The first factor was the lack of foodstuffs in the South, which led to a shortage of labor and the consequent need for soldiers to work on farms, as well as for the construction of railroads and other infrastructure. This resulted in an oversupply of foodstuffs, and in the case of cotton, a shortage of cotton and other foodstuffs. The second factor was the fact that there was a large number of Confederate soldiers who did not want to go to the war, and were willing to fight for the Union rather than for their state or their family. These soldiers had no choice but to leave their homes and join the Union army in order to be able to feed their families. In this article, we will look at the effects of the war on the food supply in the South, and what was done to try to alleviate the problem.

358;How did the Emancipation Proclamation affect African Americans in the military?;It was a big deal, and the Civil War was one of the most violent in American history. There were a lot of soldiers who had to go to the front, and many of them were black. So, they were treated like second-class citizens, and that's what happened to many of them. How did the Emancipation Proclamation affect black soldiers' ability to serve in the military? In the early 19th century, the U.S. government did not have a policy of granting citizenship to slaves. So, if a slave wanted to enlist in the military, he had to prove his freedom by paying a $5 fee to the government. If he failed to do that, he was denied citizenship. But after the War of 1812, President Andrew Jackson issued a proclamation that freed all slaves in the United States, regardless of race. That made it possible for blacks to enlist in the military without having to pay the $5 fee
359;In what ways do you think the Civil War changed people’s opinions about women’s capabilities?;There were a lot of people who thought women were inferior to men in every way. The fact that women were fighting for their lives was a shock to many people. It was an emotional reaction to the idea of women having to fight for their lives and not being able to do the same things men could do. What was your favorite moment from the film?

The study looked at the relationship between infection rates in hospitals and the number of deaths that occurred during the study period. Researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Boston University School of Medicine (BUMC), and the University of California San Franciso (UCSF) found that hospital infections were associated with a higher death rate, regardless of whether the hospital was part of a chain or not. Infections in hospitals that were part of chains tended to be more common than those in non-chain hospitals. In addition, the researchers found that hospitals with the highest infection rates were the ones that had the most patients with high-risk conditions such as heart failure, sepsis, and infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). These infections are common in hospitals, but can lead to life

He served in the War of 1812, and was wounded by a musket ball while leading a company of cavalry in an attack on Fort Snelling, Minn. In 1838, he was promoted to brigadier general and sent to Mexico to fight the Texan war of independence. He returned to the United States in 1841, and became a prominent advocate of the annexation of Texas to the Union. After the Mexican War, Sherman was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1845, and served until his death in 1864. He was succeeded by his son-in-law, John C. Calhoun,
368;Explain why the Union victory at Gettysburg was so important.;I think the Union victory at Gettysburg was a turning point in the Civil War. In 1864, Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States. He had won the popular vote by a margin of more than 2 million votes, but his opponent, Stephen A. Douglas, had won the Electoral College by a large margin. The election was decided by a vote of the House of Representatives, which gave Lincoln a majority of 270 to Douglas's 162. In that election, Lincoln won the election and became the 45th president of the United States. What was the significance of that election? The election of 1864 was an important one because it signaled the end of the War Between the States, which had been going on since 1861. The war ended in 1865, and that was the last war that the North had fought in the Civil War. It was a victory for the South, which had been fighting a war of secession for a hundred years. Why do

He paused for a moment, and said, ""That's a good question, but I don't have an answer for you."" It's hard to imagine that we would have had the kind of freedom that we have today, but that's the reality of the American experience.

372;Philip Sheridan was;"a member of the U.S. Army and served in World War II. He is the author of several books, including ""War Is a Racket: How Corporations Corrupt America"" (Regnery, 2007). This article is from the archive of our partner The Wire."
373;“Sherman neckties,” March to the Sea was;a film about the life and times of Sherman. The film, directed by Robert Altman, tells the story of a man who has lived his life in the shadow of his father, an Army general who died in World War II. The character is played by John Huston, who won an Oscar for his portrayal of Humphrey Bogart in The Maltese Falcon. In addition to Huston, the film features a cast that includes Richard Widmark, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Peter Ustinov, and John Cassavetes. Huston was born in Los Angeles, the son of a writer and his wife (whom he would marry in 1947). His father was a successful screenwriter, and the family moved to New York when he was four years old to pursue a career in film. After graduating from high school, he went to work for Columbia Pictures, where he became a production assistant and worked on films such as Gone with the Wind
374;Thirteenth Amendment was;"ratified in 1868. A few years later, the Supreme Court struck down a law that made it a crime to be gay in New York, and in the same year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could not ban same-sex marriage on the basis of religious beliefs. But that's not the end of the story. As of today, there are no federal laws that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, according to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), a gay rights group that advocates for equality. The HRC has been working to change that, and in recent years, it has launched a campaign called ""Love Wins,"" which aims to raise awareness about the discrimination LGBT people face every day. ""We're going to continue to make sure that people know that they're not alone,"" HRC President Chad Griffin said in a press release. ""Love Wins is an important step in the right direction, and we look forward to seeing it take root"
375;Appomattox Courthouse was;the site of the Battle of Gettysburg. It has a museum and the Civil War National Monument in its grounds. A memorial to the victims of the 9/11 attacks is on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. The White House has an observatory, a National Zoo and the George Washington Carver Botanical Garden. There are two state capitols, Virginia and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia. Washington, D.C.'s capital is home to the Smithsonian Institution, which opened in 1871. The city has more than 1,000 miles of roads, and it is one of the most densely populated cities in the United States. The Washington metropolitan area includes Arlington, Loudoun, Prince William and Fairfax counties, the nation's capital. The District of Columbia is a city of more than 200,000 people, and it is the largest city in
376;John Wilkes Booth was;"a slave who escaped from slavery to join the Union Army. Booth's escape, however, was the subject of a book by William Faulkner, The Confessions of Nat Turner, which won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1922. The book details the life of Turner, an abolitionist and Confederate sympathizer who led a slave rebellion in 1831. Turner was convicted of treason and sentenced to death, but the Supreme Court overturned his conviction in 1833 after a trial that lasted less than two hours. The decision was based on the theory that Turner had no right to free himself from slavery and was therefore free to leave the United States if he chose. In his book, Faulkner wrote that he was ""astonished"" by the decision, but he did not write an essay on the case or discuss it in his book. Instead, he wrote a series of letters to his friend Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who was the editor of Harper's"
377;Describe how General Grant conducted the Confederate surrender.;General Grant: I was in command of the Army of the Potomac and had a very clear idea of what was going to happen. The Confederates were to surrender at Appomattox Court House, and I wanted to make sure that they did, and so I sent a message to General Halleck and asked him to come to my headquarters and give me the surrender order. He came, and I gave him the order, and he went to the commandant of the prison, and told him that he was the commanding officer of the prison, and that he had to obey the order of the general commanding. The commandant, however, refused to obey, and so I had to take his orders into my own hands. I had no time to get the prisoners into the prison, and when I did get them into the prison, it was a long time before they were brought out. They were kept in a sort of cage, and the only way in which they could
378;How did Northern military strategy change after General Ulysses S. Grant took command of the Union army?;"In 1864, the United States was at war with Great Britain. Grant had been appointed to the post of commander in chief of the Army of the Potomac, which was responsible for the defense of the Carolinas and Georgia. He was a veteran of the Civil War and had served as a brigadier general in the Mexican-American War. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website After his appointment, Grant began to build a reputation as a tactician, and his strategy was a key part of that reputation. He used guerrilla warfare to gain ground in the South, and he was able to do so without resorting to large-scale artillery bombardments. Instead, he relied on small skirmishes that were fought in the open, with little or no support from the army. This strategy, known as ""peacemaking,"" helped the Union win the war. During the War of 1812, which lasted"
379;What was the effect of Farragut’s blockade of Mobile Bay?;In 1864, the United States had to pay $1.5 million to Mobile Bay for damages caused by the blockade, which lasted from April to October 1864. This was the largest sum paid by the United States to a port in the South during the Civil War. It is estimated that the blockade contributed to the loss of more than one million men, women, and children from the South during the war. What was the effect of Farragut's blockade of Mobile Bay? Farragut's blockade had a devastating effect on the lives of those who lived in Mobile Bay. It was one of the most destructive acts of blockade-breaking in American history. Mobile Bay was home to a population of more than 100,000 people, of whom more than half were African-American. It was the largest slave port in the South and a center of the transatlantic slave trade. The population of Mobile Bay was reduced by more than half in the first year
380;What would account for the thousands of non-battle deaths listed in one of the charts?;"I don't know, but it's a good place to start. In any case, this is the kind of data that should be used to inform policy and decision-making, not to create a list of ""victims"" for political purposes. The US has a long history of war crimes, and we need to be honest about that history in order to move forward with a better world for all of us."

382;Thaddeus Stevens was;a member of the U.S. Navy for 25 years. He retired in 2012 as a Rear Admiral in the U.S. Navy Reserve.
383;Radical Republicans was;the name of a book I read in high school. It was a good book, but the title was a misnomer. The book was about the rise of the New Right, a movement that would come to dominate the Republican Party for the next half century. The New Right was an amalgam of right-wing populism, nativism, anti-elitism, and a belief that government was the problem rather than the solution to America's ills. In other words, it was a political movement based on the idea that the United States had gone astray and needed to be restored to its founding principles of limited government, free markets, and individual liberty. I'm not going to pretend that this is a novel or an easy read. It's hard to get your head around the ideas that are at the heart of the book, and even harder to figure out how they fit together into a coherent political philosophy. But if you're interested in politics, you need to read
384;Wade-Davis Bill was;a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from South Carolina. He was the longest serving African-American in Congress at the time of his death in 2010. The following is a list of his most notable achievements: Achievements in the United States House of Representatives (1910-2010) Represented South Carolina in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1910 to 1910 and again from 1910 to 1910. Introduced the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap (e.g., blindness), or familial status in public accommodations. Served as a member of the Committee on the Judiciary, where he helped draft the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1887 and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1933. In addition to his legislative work, Wade-Davis was a civil rights activist and an outspoken opponent of segregation in the South. He led
385;Freedmen’s Bureau was;a federal agency created by the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 to investigate fugitive slaves. In 1853, the Freedmen's Bureau began its work on the Underground Railroad, an underground railroad that ran from New York to the Carolinas and across the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico. The Underground Railroad was one of the most important civil rights movements of the 19th century and helped bring about the end of slavery in the United States. Fremont, CA is the capital of California, and it has a population of approximately 4,000. Fremont is located in San Mateo County, about 30 miles north of San Francisco. The city of Fremont is home to the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), a research university that offers degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The University of California, Santa Cruz is the largest university in the state of California, with more than 30,000 students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs.
386;Explain why the efforts to provide African Americans with their own land failed.;What is the most important lesson you learned from your research? That there is no magic formula to get rid of racism. It's a matter of understanding the root causes of racism and working to change them. The more we learn about racism, the better we can fight it in our own communities and across the country. Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1MmYxXh
387;What services did the Freedmen’s Bureau provide to Southern refugees and to newly freed people?;"The Freedmen's Bureau was a central part of the Civil Rights Movement. In the summer of 1866, a group of Southern abolitionists met in New York to discuss the need for a ""Negro Bureau"" to help the newly freed slaves find jobs and other social services. The idea was that, by working with the freedmen, they could provide a more integrated community than was possible in the North. They proposed the creation of a bureau that would be staffed by African-Americans and other people of color, and that its work would be coordinated by an executive committee composed of representatives of the local community. This was an important step in the integration of the South, and it is one of the reasons that the NAACP was founded in the South and not in the North. How did the Freedmen's Bureau deal with the problems that arose during the Reconstruction period? The Freedmen's Bureau had a long history of helping people who were in need of help and had no"
388;What are the benefits of a compromise such as the Wade-Davis Bill to a government? What are the drawbacks?;I am sure there are a number of people who have read the Bill and think it is a good idea. But the fact is that this Bill does not go far enough in protecting the privacy of Canadians, and it is far too broad and too broad-minded for the purpose of protecting our security. The Bill, as it stands, would allow CSIS to spy on Canadians without a warrant, even if they are suspected of a crime. This is an unacceptable invasion of privacy and a threat to the rights of Canadians to be free from unwarranted intrusion into their private lives. In addition, the Bill would allow CSIS to share information with other law enforcement agencies in the name of national security and the public good. This information could be used to investigate, disrupt and prevent terrorist activity, but it could also be used for political purposes or to intimidate or coerce Canadians into giving up their privacy. The Bill also contains provisions that are inconsistent with the Charter of Rights

390;Civil Rights Act was;"a response to Jim Crow. The Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that segregation was unconstitutional, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of race in public accommodations such as restaurants, hotels, hotels, theaters, etc. This is the law that protects you from discrimination in the workplace, housing, and other areas of public life. What is a ""disparate impact"" and how does it apply to race? In order to be protected under the Fair Housing Act, you must show that your property is used for a purpose that is ""discriminatory against persons of a particular race or color."" This means that the use of your property in a way that discriminates against people of a particular race or color is a violation of the law. For example, if you are renting a room to African Americans, but your landlord refuses to rent to white people, that would be a violation of the Fair Housing Act."
391;Fourteenth Amendment was;"ratified in 1868. A state may require a person to register with the state as a sex offender if the person is convicted of a sex offense or has been adjudicated a sexually violent predator. A person may be required to register under this section even if the person does not have a criminal record, has not been convicted of a sex offense, and has not been adjudicated a sexually violent predator. (Ord. O-2012-9 § 2, 2012; Ord. O-2012-10 § 1, 2012; Ord. O-2012-11 § 1, 2012; Ord. O-2012-12 § 1, 2012; Ord. O-2012-13 § 1, 2012; Ord. O-2012-14 § 1, 2012; Ord. O-2012-15 § 1, 2012; Ord.

392;Military Reconstruction Act was;"a federal law that provided for the establishment of a federal government in the United States. This federal government was to have the power to declare war, make treaties, appoint judges, regulate commerce, raise and support armies, and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States. The Reconstruction Act of 1877, however, did not include a declaration of war, and Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act in 1879 to do just that. The Taft-Hartley Act established the War Powers Resolution (WPR), which gave Congress the power to declare war if it could show that the war would be necessary to preserve the nation from ""substantial and irremediable damage."" In other words, the WPR required Congress to be able to justify a war in the public interest, and it was this power that was used to justify the Civil War. The War Powers Resolution is one of the most important pieces of legislation in American history, and it has played"
393;Tenure of Office Act was;"a response to the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. It allows corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections without disclosing who is paying for the ads, as long as they do not coordinate with a candidate or political party. The law has been criticized by the American Civil Liberties Union as a form of corporate free speech. In his speech, Trump said he would appoint justices who would overturn the law if he wins the White House. ""I am going to do everything within my power to make sure this law is overturned,"" Trump said. ""It's bad for our country, bad for our country. And we're going to have a Supreme Court that's going to say it's not a free speech issue, it's a First Amendment issue."" The Republican National Committee released a statement on Trump's campaign announcement. ""Donald Trump has a long history of supporting policies that threaten the rights of women, LGBT Americans, people of color, and other Americans,"""
394;Evaluate why the congressional election of 1866 was significant to the Radical Republicans.;What is the relationship between the Civil War and the American Revolution? In 1776, a group of Revolutionary War veterans formed the Sons of Liberty to fight for the independence of the United States. This group was led by Benjamin Franklin, who was born in England, and later became a U.S. citizen. The Sons of Liberty became a political party in the United States, and it won a number of state and local elections during the Revolutionary War. In 1812, the Sons of Liberty were the first group of American patriots to receive the Medal of Honor for their role in the Battle of Saratoga (see below). What was the role of the Sons of Liberty in the American Revolution? The Sons of Liberty played a major role in the American Revolution by providing arms and training to the Continental Army and fighting in the War of 1812. They were also instrumental in helping to organize the Patriot Party, which was formed in 1776. The Sons of
395;What actions by the Radical Republicans were intended to protect the civil rights of African Americans?;A number of them were, in fact, directed at the Negroes of the South and the Northern industrial workers. But it is important to note that these actions were not limited to that section of the country. In many cases, the Radical Republicans were acting in the interests of the working class as a whole, not just the Negroes of the South. For example, the Republican Party of New York, which was a part of the Progressive Party, opposed the Ku Klux Klan and other forms of racial discrimination in the labor movement. It did not hesitate to take a stand against lynching, which was an integral part of the Klan's campaign of terror against the Negroes of the South. What was the reaction of the American ruling class to the actions of the Radical Republicans? This reaction was one of the most bitter in the history of the United States. On the one hand, the American ruling class had no choice but to respond to the radical Republicans by mobilizing the
396;Do you think Presidents Lincoln and Johnson were wise in not seeking harsh treatment of the Southern states? Why or why not?;A lot of people have a hard time thinking about this, but it's a good question. I'm not sure I have an answer to it. The South was in a state of war with the United States at the time, and they had no choice but to fight for their independence. The Civil War was a war of secession, not a war of slavery. It was an attempt to break up the Union by a bunch of slaveholders and their political cronies in the South. So, yes, they were right to do what they did, but it was a terrible mistake on their part. They should have stayed out of the war as much as possible, and that's what they're supposed to do in a free country. Do you think President Obama's decision to send troops to Libya in 2011 was the right thing to do? What was your reaction to the death of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in the attack that took place on
397;Imagine that you are a citizen during Andrew Johnson’s administration. Write a letter to a member of Congress urging him to vote either for or against Johnson’s impeachment.;The letter should be signed by at least one person who has lived in the United States for at least five years, and it should state that you are a citizen and intend to vote in the election that will take place on November 8, 1868. You can find your state in the list of states that have ratified the Constitution. If you live in a state that has not ratified the Constitution, you can use this site to find out how to do so. Write your letter to the person who will be in charge of the House of Representatives at the time of the election, and ask him or her to send a copy by certified mail to the office of the President of the United States. The President's signature is required on the certified copy. If you do not have a mailing address or do not know where to send your letter, you can use the postal service to send it, as long as it is postmarked no later than the day before the election
398;Joseph Rainey was;"a student at St. John's University in New York when he began to feel the effects of a rare form of cancer called sarcoma. The disease is rare in the United States, but Rainey's case was not unusual. In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers found that nearly one in five people with sarcoma will die before their diagnosis is made. ""I thought it was going to be a slow death,"" Rainey said. ""It took six months for it to get to that point."" Rainey, who has lived in the Bronx since the age of 3, said he's had to learn to deal with the pain and uncertainty that comes with being a cancer survivor. ""You have to be a little crazy, a little manic, but at the same time you have to keep your head in the game,"" he said. ""If you're not doing that, you're going to lose the battle."""
399;Hiram Revels was;"a member of the New York Police Department. The FBI said Revels, 33, of the Bronx, was arrested on charges of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin and cocaine, as well as money laundering. Revels' bail was set at $1 million and he was scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in New York on Wednesday, according to the FBI. A spokesman for the NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reporting by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Sandra Maler)"
400;Ku Klux Klan Act was;"a response to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In the 1960s, there was a lot of talk about ""separate but equal"" schools for African-American and white children. The Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that segregation was unconstitutional, and it became a rallying cry for civil rights activists to fight for desegregation in public schools. But that's not what happened. Instead, schools became segregated by race, with white students getting preferential treatment in many cases. In the early 1970s, President Richard Nixon signed the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, which made it illegal to engage in ""disparate impact"" — that is, targeting people based on race or ethnic origin. This led to the creation of the Office of Civil Rights (OCR), which investigated complaints of racial discrimination in the criminal justice system. The OCR found that police and school officials were using race as a factor in deciding who should be arrested"
401;Describe how some white Southerners reacted to the Republican Party gaining power in the South.;"What is the history of slavery in the United States? Why do you think it is important to speak out against racism? How do you feel about President Obama's policies on race? What are your thoughts on the Black Lives Matter movement? What does it mean to be a ""snowflake"" in today's society? What is it like to live in a city with a majority black population? What do you think of Donald Trump as a presidential candidate? What do you think of Hillary Clinton's campaign for president? What do you think of Bernie Sanders' campaign for president? What do you think of the Republican and Democratic parties as a whole?

402;How did the establishment of schools, churches, and social organizations benefit African American s during Reconstruction?;What is the relationship between the Civil Rights Movement and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan? Why did Reconstruction end in 1877 and not in 1877-1878 as many historians believe? How did the South become a slave state after the War of 1812? What role did slavery play in the American Revolution and the Civil War? What were the causes of the Great Depression of the 1930s? The Origins of Slavery in the United States In the 17th century, Africans were brought to the New World as indentured servants. By the mid-19th century, slavery had become a legal institution in the United States. The first slave ship arrived in New York Harbor in 1609, and the first slaves were brought to the West Indies in 1630. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the number of slaves increased, especially in the South. By the end of the 19th century, there were more than
403;Why did white Southerners resent both carpetbaggers and scalawags?;"It's hard to say for sure, but one possibility is that they were resentful of the ""scalawag"" status that came with being a slaveholder. In other words, white Southerners felt a kinship with the people who lived in the Deep South, and that made them resentful of those who came from the North. This could have been the case even before the Civil War, as many of the South's most prominent slaveholders were from the North. The Southern response to the abolition of slavery was a series of rebellions, which led to the formation of the Confederate States of America in 1861. These revolts were led by a group of Southern states that wanted to preserve slavery and the system of slavery as a way of life. The South fought back by taking up arms against the Union, and in doing so, became a nation-state in the process. What is your take on the role of race in today's political discourse?"
404;Imagine you are living in the postwar South. You are either a Northerner who has recently moved there or a longtime Southern resident. Write a friend and describe Southern life as you see it.;What do you find to be the most interesting aspect of Southern life? The South is a land of contrasts. On one hand, it is home to some of the most beautiful scenery in the world, from the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina to the Gulf of Mexico in Texas. On the other hand, there is a lot of poverty, crime, and social dysfunction. I think this is one of the reasons why so many people from the South are interested in the United States. How would you describe your home state of Georgia? Georgia is an interesting place to live. It has a rich history and is one of the most diverse states in the country. The diversity of Georgia is reflected in the diversity of people living in Georgia. There are more than 1,000 languages spoken in Georgia, and many of them are related to each other. Georgia is also home to many African-Americans, who make up a large portion of the state's population.
405;Horace Greeley was;"a member of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1877 to 1883. Greeley's most famous case was a decision upholding the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which made it illegal to bring slaves back to the United States if they were free in their home countries. The decision was based on the idea that slavery was a ""tradition of barbarism"" and ""an abominable and detestable institution."" In his dissent, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote, ""I have no doubt that the opinion of the court will be followed by every man who cares to be a slave, and that it will become the law of the land.""

406;“Whiskey Ring,” Panic of 1873 was;"a novel by James Fenimore Cooper. It tells the story of a man who has lost his wife and is trying to make ends meet by selling whiskey to his fellow soldiers in the Civil War. In the novel, the main character, Henry ""Hank"" Henshaw, is an ex-soldier and a self-taught distiller. His wife, Mary, died of typhoid fever while he was away on a war-time mission. He has a young son, Jack, and a wife, Martha, who are living with their parents in a farmhouse on the outskirts of Boston. Henshaw, however, does not have the money to pay for his son's education, so he turns to the black market for supplies and proceeds to make a lot of whiskey, which he sells to the soldiers for a few pennies a bottle. When one of the soldiers asks for a bottle of whiskey, Henshaw says he has no money, but offers"
407;Compromise of187 was;the most powerful of the three. It's a shame to have lost such a great player, but I'm glad we did. He was one of the best players in the world and a huge part of our success as a team. The team has been in a state of flux this year with a number of players leaving the team for personal reasons. How do you deal with that? It's hard to be the same team as you were before, but we try to keep the spirit of the team the same. We're a team that's going to fight for each other no matter what. That's what makes us great. What's your relationship with Alex Ovechkin and the rest of the Capitals? Alex Ovechkin is an amazing player and a great person. He's always been there for me and I'm thankful for that. We have a great relationship and it's great to play with him every night. You
408;What factors contributed to improving the economy of the South after Reconstruction?;A number of factors, including the creation of the National Recovery Administration (NRA), which helped the South recover from the Great Depression and was a key factor in the economic growth of the 1950s and 1960s. Another factor was the Civil Rights Movement, which led to a greater emphasis on education and job training for African Americans and other minority groups. Finally, there was the growth of the South's manufacturing base, which provided a base for the nation's recovery. What is the most important lesson to be learned from the history of the South? It is important to remember that the South was a part of the United States for a long time before the Civil War. In fact, the Southern states were the first to secede from the Union in 1864, and many of the secessionist states continued to hold out for a separate and independent South until the end of the 19th century. The fact that the South has remained in the Union despite its history of secession
409;How did the disputed election of 1876 affect Reconstruction policy?;The election of 1876 was a turning point in U.S. history. In the years leading up to the election, there was a lot of talk about what to do about the Civil War. President Andrew Johnson was in the White House, and many people in the Republican Party wanted to do something about it. But they had no idea how to do it. The Republicans had a very different view of Reconstruction than the Democrats, and that's one of the reasons why Reconstruction was such a hard thing to get done. What was the role of the Supreme Court in Reconstruction? The Supreme Court played a very important role in Reconstruction. They made it very, very difficult for the South to secede from the Union. It was a big part of the reason why Southern states seceded in the first place. But in many ways, the Reconstruction era was the most successful period of the South's relationship with the federal government. How did Reconstruction affect the South
410;What details did the artist include in this painting to suggest dynamic activity?;A few things: the sun was in the sky, there was a river flowing through the background, and it was raining. I wanted people to feel that this was a place of life and life was happening in the background. What was the most challenging aspect of creating this painting? The most challenging aspect was that I had to work with so many different materials, which is a lot of work. It took a long time to get the colors right, and the water was the hardest part. I was trying to find a way to make it look like water, without being too watery. Do you have any advice for artists looking to get their work into the public eye? If you want to be successful, you have to do your research. Find out what people are interested in, and try to create something that fits their taste. You can't be afraid of your work, because it's going to be seen by a lot of people.

412;Henry Comstock was;a member of the New York Stock Exchange. He died in 1883 and his estate was divided among his children. The largest share went to his son-in-law, Charles B. Harker, who had a long career in banking and stockbroking before becoming a partner in the firm of W. A. Harriman & Co. and later the president of Standard Oil of New Jersey. Mr. Harker's heirs were able to keep most of the money, but a few years later, in the 1920s, the family was in trouble, and it was sold to an investment firm in New York. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The family's fortunes began to improve in the early 1930s, when the Depression was at its worst. In the years that followed, the Comstock family became one of the wealthiest families in the United States, with assets estimated at $1.5 billion by the end of the 1930s.

414;Chisholm Trail was;"the first of its kind to be built in the U.S. It's a 1.5-mile trail with a maximum elevation of 8,000 feet. There are no water fountains, but hikers can refill their water bottles at a kiosk on the trail. The trail starts at the parking lot and heads up the hill, passing a number of overlooks along the way. ""You're in the middle of nowhere,"" Karp said. ""It's not like any trail I've been on."" Karp said he's seen people hiking for as long as two hours and they're not the only ones doing it. ""People have been coming from all over the country to get a glimpse of the Grand Canyon,"" he said. The park has been working on the trail for the past few years and hopes to open it to the public in the fall of 2017."

""We're going to have a fence that's as high as the Empire State Building, and it's going to stop people from coming into the United States,"" Trump said. ""And if they're here illegally, they're going to have to go back to their country. We're going to build a wall, and Mexico is going to pay for the wall."" The border wall has been a hot topic in the presidential campaign, with Trump calling it ""the most important thing we have going for us"" during a rally in San Luis Potosí, Mexico last month. But it's unclear how Trump plans to pay for the wall, which he has promised to build on the U.S.-Mexico border for $10 billion to $12 billion."
416;List the factors that contributed to the rise of the cattle industry.;In the past, farmers had to rely on a variety of methods to raise cattle, such as feeding the animals grain, milking them, and slaughtering them. The introduction of large-scale production of feed grains led to a shift in the way cattle were raised and raised cattle became more efficient at converting feed into meat, resulting in higher profit margins for ranchers. This in turn led to an increase in the number of cattle in the United States, which in turn led to more land being used for cattle production. Cattle ranching has been on the decline for the past 50 years, and it is expected to continue to decline in the future. However, there are a number of factors that have contributed to the decline of the cattle industry over the past few decades. One of the most important factors is the decline of the U.S. population. As a result of this decline, the demand for beef has decreased, as well as the supply of cattle to feed the
417;Explain how cattle ranching shifted from open range to an organized business operation.;"What was the impact of the Great Depression on ranchers' ability to make a living? How did the rise of mechanization affect the cattle industry? What were the economic and social changes that occurred during the 1930s and 1940s? Why is it important to have a history of the U.S. cattle industry? The following questions are part of the course requirements for the B.S. in Agriculture degree at Iowa State University. Students must complete at least 30 credits of coursework and be in good academic standing by the end of the second semester. The coursework is divided into three sections: (1) Introduction to Livestock; (2) Livestock Management; and (3) Cattle Management. Each section has a minimum of three credit hours and a maximum of six credit hours. The courses in the first section are designed to provide students with a foundation in the science of livestock management and management of cattle, while the courses"
418;What two developments in the late 1800s led to the decline of the cattle business?;One was the introduction of antibiotics to control disease, which was a boon to farmers who could no longer afford to feed their animals. The other was mechanization, which reduced the need for labor and made it possible for farmers to produce more and more food at a lower cost. In 1884, for example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) began a program to train farmers in the use of tractors and combine harvesters. By the mid-19th century, most of the country's corn was grown on small farms, and the number of cattle was in decline. What was the impact of this decline on the American farmer? Cattle prices fell from $1.50 per bushel in 1884 to less than $1.10 per bushel in 1900—a loss of more than 50 percent in one generation. The price of feed, which accounted for the lion's share of the farmer's income, fell from $1
419;How did the mining industry contribute to the development of theWest?;What is the relationship between the mining industry and the West in general? Mining is a key factor in the development of the West. It has played a major role in the development of the region and the economy as a whole. The West was the first region to develop a large-scale industrial sector, and this was due to the fact that there was a surplus of minerals in the region at the time. In order to exploit this surplus, the miners had to be brought in from other parts of the world and work in conditions that were far from their home country. This created a demand for labour in the West, which led to the formation of the mining industry. Today, the mines are one of the most important industries in the West, accounting for more than 50 per cent of the country's GDP. They provide employment for more than one million people, and their contribution to the West's economy is estimated to be $1.5 billion per annum. How

421;Great Plains was;the name of a region in the United States. Contents show] Geography Edit The Great Plains was an arid, semi-tropical region that spanned much of North America, from the Gulf of Mexico all the way to the Rocky Mountains. Its name comes from the plains, which were covered in grass, as well as the fact that most of the land was flat.[1] Inhabitants of the Great Plains included Plains Indians, Plains Boers, Plains Cattlemen, Plains Mennonites, Plains Celts, Plains Celts, Plains Indians, Plains Indians, Plains Plainsmen, Plains Plainscrafters, Plainscrafters, Plainscrafters, Plainscrafters, Plainscrafters, Plainscrafters, Plainscrafters, Plainscrafters, Plainscrafters, Plainscrafters, Plainscrafters, Plainscrafters, Plainscrafters, Plainscrafters,

Long, an English professor at New York University, wrote the book in response to the death of his father, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease. The book chronicles his father's life and struggles with the disease, which left him unable to speak, walk without crutches or use a walker for more than a few minutes at a time. ""I think it's a book that will resonate with a lot of people,"" Long said in an interview with ABC News. ""It's about being in the middle of a battle, and the battle is to live your life to the fullest and not give up on the things that you care about.""

423;Homestead Act was;"a response to the ""dramatic increase in land values in the United States over the past 50 years."" It's unclear what will happen to the land, but a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) told Business Insider in an email that they are ""looking into the matter."" ""If it turns out to be a violation of the National Environmental Policy Act, USDA will take appropriate action,"" the spokesperson said. The Trump administration has been in the news a lot since taking office, with reports of Trump's plans to roll back environmental regulations and the appointment of Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In addition to the land issue, there's also an ongoing lawsuit over the Dakota Access Pipeline, which is expected to run through the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. That case is still pending before the U.S. District Court in North Dakota."
424;Wheat Belt was;the first to make the switch to electric, in 1891. The switch was a big deal for a couple of reasons. First, it meant that people could go to work without worrying about running out of power, and that was a big deal for farmers, who had to be able to produce a lot of food in a short amount of time. Second, it meant that the power grid was no longer the bottleneck that it had been in the past. Farmers could use the grid to get power to their farms, and that made them more efficient and helped reduce the carbon footprint of the food they produced. Today, there are more than 1,000 electric vehicles on the road in the United States, according to Edmunds.com. That's up from a few hundred in the 1970s and '80s, and it's expected to grow to more than 2,000 by the end of the decade. But the electric car has its critics, who say it's

426;How did the need for new farming techniques on the Great Plains result in technological innovations in agriculture?;It's hard to say what the origins of the agricultural revolution are, but we have a lot of evidence that there was a shift in the distribution of land in the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, which may have led to an increase in population density and food production. This was the time of the Ice Age, when climate change was a major factor in the loss of arable land and the expansion of human populations around the world. How did humans adapt to the changes in their environment? Humans are the only species that has the ability to move from one place to another, and that's what makes us unique. We have a very long history of doing this, and our adaptation to new environments is one of the most important things we do in the world—not just as humans, but as a species. What is the relationship between agriculture and urbanization? Agriculture is a way of growing food for a population that is growing
427;What factors contributed to the making of the Wheat Belt in the Great Plains and then to troubled times for wheat farmers in the 1890s?;It's hard to say, but one thing is clear: a lot of people had to work harder than they had in the past to get the job done. The number of people working in the wheat industry was down from its peak in 1885, and there were a lot of factors at play that led to that. What was the most important factor in the demise of the Wheat Belt? The first thing was mechanization, which was a big factor. In the early days, people worked with hand tools, and that was the way it was done. As machines came into the picture, people had to learn to use them, and that took a lot of time and effort. Then there was the introduction of irrigation, which made it possible to irrigate the land more efficiently and to do it in a way that was less labor-intensive. How did this new technology affect the price of wheat? Wheat prices went through the roof in the 1890

429;Little Crow was;"a member of the ""Celtic Brotherhood"" who, according to his obituary, ""lived the life of a gentleman."" In the end, Crow's death was the result of a heart attack, which he suffered on the way to the hospital. The cause of death was listed as hypertensive heart disease. Crow had a long and distinguished career in the music industry as a recording artist, songwriter, arranger, producer, and producer of film scores. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1991. His music has been covered by artists such as Bob Dylan, Neil Peart, The Rolling Stones, Paul Anka, John Mellencamp, and many others. Crow is survived by his wife of 52 years, the former Mary Crow, and their two children, a son and daughter-in-law."
430;Indian Peace Commission was;"established in the wake of the partition of India. It had its headquarters in Calcutta and a staff of about 1,000, including officers from the Indian Army, the police and civil administration as well as representatives of the Muslim League, the National Conference of the Muslim League and the Hindu Mahasabha. The commission was to report to the Prime Minister and the Home Minister on the state of affairs in each of the states, with a view to making recommendations to the Union Government. On the day of its establishment, the British government issued a press release announcing that it had appointed a commission of enquiry headed by Sir Henry Rawlinson, ""the most distinguished jurist of his time"". Rawlinson was a barrister by training and had served as a judge of the High Court of Bombay and the Supreme Court of India before joining the commission. His appointment was a coup for Jinnah, who had been in the process of building a coalition government of his own since"
431;George A. Custer was;"a pioneer in the use of radio to communicate with Native Americans. In 1876, he sent a telegram to his son-in-law, George W. Bush, asking him to come to the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota to help fight the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). The pipeline would carry Bakken crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois, where it would be shipped to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. Custer had no intention of going to war with the United States, but he wanted to make a statement about the injustices that Native Americans were facing at the hands of white settlers. ""We are a people of the plains and not the prairieland,"" he wrote in the missive, which was published in the Sioux City Journal on December 1, 1876. ""It is our duty to stand in the way of the evil that threatens us, and to do all in our power to prevent its coming to pass."""
432;Ghost Dance was;the first to make a splash in the music industry. It's a dance that has been around since the dawn of time, but the genre is not well known to the general public. But that's changing thanks to an upsurge in dance music fans who are finding it hard to keep up with the ever-evolving styles of dance music. Dance music fan, DJ and producer Mike Will Made-It (MICSHEAKS) has spent the last two years working on his debut album, Dance Is The New Rap, which is set to drop in the fall of 2017. The album features collaborations with a host of artists, including The Weeknd, Diplo, Zaytoven, Tiesto, Skrillex, and more. MICSHEAKS spoke with HipHopDX about the inspiration behind the album, what it's like to be a DJ on the rise, and why he's excited for the future of dance music

""I'm proud to stand with my colleagues in the Senate and support this commonsense legislation,"" McCaskill said. ""It's long past time for Congress to take a stand against sexual assault on our nation's college campuses."" The House of Representatives passed the bill last week by a vote of 227-205.

434;Analyze how Native Americans responded to land lost due to white settlement of the Great Plains.;What is the role of government in Native American communities? How do they contribute to the well-being of Native Americans? This study examines the relationship between government and Native American communities in the United States and in other parts of the world. The results are based on data from the General Social Survey (GSS), a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago in 1988-89. The GSS is the most widely used source of social and demographic information on the American population. This study uses a variety of methods to analyze the responses of Native Americans to changes in their community and to the policies and programs of the federal government. What are the most important issues facing Native Americans today? What can be done to address these issues? This study analyzes the issues that have been identified as the most important to Native Americans in the last 30 years, and how they have changed over time. The issues are divided into three categories
435;How did Chief Joseph resist the government’s attempts to move the Nez Perce to reservations?;"He did so in a way that made him a hero to Native Americans, who saw him as a man of integrity and integrity in the face of government oppression. The chief had the audacity to stand up to the U.S. government and say, ""You're going to have to leave my people alone if you want to be a part of this country."" That's what he did. And it was an amazing thing to see him do, because you could see the tears in his eyes as he was telling the government, ""No, I'm not going to give up my people to you. I'm going to fight for my people, and I'm going to do it with my life."" How did you get to know Chief Joseph? I was working on a documentary about the Navajo Code Talkers, and one of the coders in the code was a Navajo woman named Laniya Pacheco. She came to my office and asked if I wanted"
436;Why do you think the government’s policy of assimilation of Native Americans was a failure?;A lot of people are trying to make it seem like it was a success, but the truth is that we have a lot of problems in this country. There are a lot of people who want to assimilate and take our culture and our way of life, and that's not what America is about. We're a melting pot, and we need to stay that way. I think that's the best way to look at it. How do you feel about Donald Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants being rapists and drug mules? He's a racist, and that's what he is. It's not a question of being anti-Mexican, it's a question of being anti-white. If you're going to talk about immigration, you have to talk about the fact that it's an invasion of a people, and that's what it is. It's not a race thing. It's a cultural thing. And that's what Trump is doing. He
437;Then, from the point of view of a historian, explain the actions taken against Native Americans within the historical context of the time. Reasons for Failure;There are a number of reasons why this is a failure, not an opportunity. First, we have no way of knowing what was going on in the minds of the people who took the land, or the motives of those who did the taking. This is not to say that the actions were unjust, but it is to say that we cannot be sure of the motives and the motives of those who took the land. Second, we do not have the time or the resources to go through the history of the land and figure out what the people were thinking at the time. The history of the land is a long and complex one, and it would take a lot of time and resources to do a thorough job of researching it. Finally, there is the problem of time. If one were to look at the events of 1868-1869, one would find that many of the people who took the land were in their thirties or forties, and they had little or no experience
438;Assume the role of a Plains Indian affected by the assimilation policy of the Dawes Act. Write a journal entry describing how you feel about the policy and how it has affected your life.;"What is the difference between ""white"" and ""non-white""? White is a noun that refers to people who are white, and non-white is a noun that refers to people who are not white. For example, a white person is a person who is white. If you are white, you are white. If you are not white, you are not white. The distinction is important because it helps us understand the meaning of words and how they are used in everyday speech. Why do people say ""I love you"" when they mean ""I am your love""? When people say ""I love you,"" they are expressing affection for another person. This affection is a form of love, and it is the same as love expressed in other ways such as friendship, friendship with a romantic partner, friendship with a family member, and so on. In this way, the word ""love"" is similar to the word ""emotion"" in that both words"

440;stock was;one of the best-known and most successful brands in the United States. It's hard to imagine a time when the American flag was used as a marketing tool, but that's exactly what happened in 1868 when the U.S. Mint began issuing pennies with the Stars and Stripes on the obverse and the Union Jack on the reverse. This was a bold move that helped establish the Mint as a national treasure and set the stage for the Civil War, which would last until 1877. Today, you can find a variety of designs that are based on the Mint's designs, such as the $1 coin that was minted in the mid-19th century, and the commemorative coins that have become popular over the past few years. But there's no denying that the Star Spangled Banner is one of the most recognizable images in the world, and it's no surprise that many people are willing to pay a premium for a coin that bears that image.

In an interview last week, Bessemer said he would be willing to settle the case for $5 million, but declined to say how much he was willing to pay. ""I have no intention of settling,"" he said. ""It's a matter of public record that this was a failed process, and the court is going to make a decision on that."" A lawyer for the school district did not return a call seeking comment. The lawsuit is the latest in a series of high-profile school desegregation cases that have drawn national attention to the challenges faced by African-American students who want to attend white schools.

Board of Education, the Supreme Court ruled in 1954 that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, but it did not end the practice of segregating students by race. Since then, more than"
443;List the new methods of advertising and selling that helped push consumer goods in the late 1800s.;A few years ago I wrote a book about the history of advertising and how it changed the way we think about advertising. In the book I looked at a number of examples of advertising in the 19th and early 20th centuries, including ads for tobacco, sugar, coffee, alcohol, soap, and more. The book was published in the United States and the U.K. and has sold well in both countries. One of the most interesting things I learned from my research was that there was a lot of competition for advertising dollars during this period. Advertising was a highly competitive business, and advertisers had to make sure they were getting the best bang for their buck. This meant spending a lot of money on research and development, which is something we've seen in the last few years as companies like Google and Facebook have become major spenders on advertising. But it also meant that advertising could get away with a lot of things that were frowned upon in other industries—for example
444;What factors allowed corporations to develop in the United States in the late 1800s?;One of the most important factors was the development of railroads. In 1849, the U.S. was the only country in the world that did not have a national railroad, which made it possible for a company to set up shop in the United States without having to deal with the government. This was a huge advantage for the railroad companies, because they could get their products to market more quickly and more affordably than they could in other countries. What was the impact of the Civil War on the development of the railroad industry? The Civil War had a huge impact on the railroads. During the war, there was a lot of talk about how to get rid of the Union army and what to do with the slaves. This led to an increase in the number of people working on the railroad and in the coal mines. The railroad companies saw this as an opportunity to expand their business and make a lot of money. How did the railroad companies respond to
445;Forming an Opinion Do you think an individual today can rise from “rags to riches” like Andrew Carnegie did? Why or why not?;The most important thing to remember is that there is no such thing as a free lunch. The best you can hope for is a little help from your fellow human beings in the form of hard work, perseverance, and the ability to think outside the box. If you are a good person, you will get the help you need and be rewarded for your efforts. But if you are not a good person, you will not get the help you need and be penalized for your lack of effort. In other words, you have two choices: You can try to make yourself better, or you can try to make someone else better. The former is a noble goal, but it is not the only way to achieve your goals. The latter is more likely to result in you becoming a victim of your own self-delusion. The second choice is the one that most people take for granted. They think that by doing good things, they will be rewarded with good things

450;List the groups of workers represented by the Knights of Labor and the American Federation of Labor.;"In this case, we are looking at the number of union members in each of the groups, which is a proxy for the strength of the union. For example, a union with 1,000 members would be counted as one member of the AFL-CIO, while a union with 2,000 members would be counted as two members of the AFSCME. This method of counting is called ""weighted union membership"" (WUC). The WUC method has its roots in the labor movement, but it is used by the Census Bureau as well to calculate the percentage of the labor force that is unionized. To get an idea of how much weight to give each group, let's take a look at the data from the most recent American Community Survey (ACS). This is the survey that was used to create the ACS, and it contains information on more than 100,000 households and is conducted every five years by the U.S. Census Bureau. The ACS"
451;What political contribution did Mary Harris “Mother” Jones make to American society?;The most obvious answer is that she was a member of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA), a party whose members were known to have supported McCarthyism in the 1950s and 1960s. Mary Harris “Mother” Jones' political contributions are listed in the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) as having been made between 1950 and 1964. NARA records show that in the years before her death in 1964, Mary Harris “Mother” Jones made at least $1,890 in political contributions to the Democratic Party, as well as a total of $4,788 to the Republican Party (which was the party of Abraham Lincoln, the father of the Republican Party). The CPUSA's website, www.cpusa.org, has a list of Mary Harris “Mother” Jones' political contributions, which is a good place to start your research if you want to find out more about her political activities.

452;Why did early labor unions fail?;The answer is that labor unions were a product of the times. In 1877, for example, there were no unions in the United States, and women were barred from working in the public sector. As a result, many women had to rely on their husbands for work, which was dangerous and often unhygienic. The lack of union protection also contributed to the rise of child labor, which led to an epidemic of infant mortality in the 1870s and 1880s. Today, women make up a majority of the workforce, but their wages are lower than they were in the past. In the early 20th century, a woman's wage was $1.50 to $2.00 per hour, compared to today's $7.25 to $9.00 per hour. The gender wage gap has narrowed over the past two decades, but it remains a significant problem for women and their families. What can be done to close the gender wage gap?

The incident took place on June 5, 2009, in the parking lot of a Marine Corps Recruit Depot in Quantico, Virginia. Four Marines and a Navy Seals were killed and more than a dozen others were wounded in the shooting. In addition to the victims, a total of nine people were injured, including the gunman, who was taken into custody by local law enforcement and remains in custody to this day.

456;Angel Island was;"a very different place in 1892. It was an island of about 1,000 people in the middle of Lake Michigan, surrounded by a chain of lakes that stretched from Michigan to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The island was home to more than a dozen Native American tribes, including the Huron, Ojibwe (who were known as the ""White Men of the Lake""), Seneca, Cayuga, Oneida, Seneca, Onondaga, and Tuscarora. In addition to the Iroquois, there were a number of French and English settlers on the island as well. As early as the 1790s, the French had established a trading post on the island, which became the base for the American fur trade. By the mid-18th century, the island had grown to a population of more than 100,000 people, most of whom lived in the city of Port Huron, located on the west side of the lake. Port"
457;Chinese Exclusion Act was;a key part of the U.S. response to the Great Depression. It barred Jews from immigrating to the United States, and in the 1930s and 1940s, thousands of Jewish refugees were rounded up and sent to concentration camps. The United States did not admit a single Jewish refugee until the mid-19th century, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). It was only in the early 20th century that the number of Jews seeking refuge in the United States began to increase. Today, there are an estimated 6.5 million Jews in the United States, making it the largest Jewish diaspora in the world. In recent years, the number of Jews living in New York City has more than doubled, from 1.2 million in 2000 to 2.2 million in 2010. But despite the growth in the Jewish population, Jews are still underrepresented in government and corporate positions, as well as in the media. The ADL

461;Why did some Americans blame immigrants for the nation’s problems?;A lot of people are angry about immigration, but it's not the only reason. Many of the problems in the United States stem from a lack of trust in government, which is a problem for any democracy. The government has to be trusted with your money, your health care, your children's education, and so on. And that trust can be broken by people who want to change the status quo. How do you respond to those who say that immigrants are taking jobs from native-born Americans? Immigrants are doing a lot of good things for the country. They're bringing new ideas and new ideas of how to run a business, and that's good for the economy as a whole. But there are a lot of jobs that are going unfilled because of the low-skilled immigration that's going on. That's the biggest problem we have right now.

The Tweed family had been a well-to-do family for many generations, but their fortunes changed in the mid-19th century when the island was colonized by the British. They lost their land and became indentured servants to the British, working as farm hands and in the shipyards. In 1888, the British took control of the island and began to build a railway to the mainland. The railway was completed in 1893, and the family was forced to leave their home on the island. Boss Tweed moved to New Zealand in 1894 and became a member of the Ngati Toa tribe. He was the first settler to establish a school for the Ngati Toa, and the school is still in use to this day.

It was a time of rapid technological change, and many people wanted to be part of the new world that was coming into being. In 1820, a group of architects led by Frederick Law Olmsted proposed a series of high-rise buildings in New York City that would serve as a model for the rest of the United States. The Olmsted Brothers were the forerunners of modern architecture, and they had an eye for design that was bold, modern, and modernist at the same time. One of the most famous examples of this was the Empire State Building, which was designed by the Brothers in 1849. This is a building that stands as a symbol of the American dream, and it's one of the most recognizable buildings in the world. But what was it like to live in the Empire State Building?

468;How did political machines respond to the needs of the people?;It's a question that we're going to explore in the next episode of the podcast. But first, let's talk about the election of 1824. In that election, the Republicans won the popular vote by a margin of 2.5 million votes, but lost the Electoral College to the Democrats. That was the first time in American history that a party had won the White House without winning the popular vote. And it set the stage for the rise of the party machine, which became the most powerful force in American politics for the next hundred years. The machine was born out of the Civil War, when Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860. The Republican Party had been in power since 1789, but it was a party of slaveholders and abolitionists, and Lincoln was an unabashed advocate of slavery. So when he ran for president, his campaign was based on a platform that called for abolishing slavery in the United States, and that was a radical idea at the time

It is based on census data from 1871-1875, as well as other sources, such as newspaper articles, government reports, and the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS). The data were compiled by a team of sociologists at the University of California, Los Angeles, and published in the Journal of Economic History (Vol. 33, No. 2, July-August, 1997). For more information about the history of poverty in the United States, see the Poverty and Inequality section of this website.

Write a letter to members of the city government listings specific reasons for the importance of setting aside city land for a park and recreational area.;This will be a short project that requires you to research the city and its history, as well as write a letter to the city council listing specific reasons for the importance of setting aside city land for a park and recreational area. The goal is to get as many people as possible on board with the idea, so you'll need to be creative with your letter. If you're a native New Yorker, it's likely that you have a lot of experience with urban planning, and you can use that to your advantage. For example, if you've lived in New York for a long time, you may know what parks are like and how they're set aside for the public to enjoy. If you're not familiar with this type of planning, you may want to look into this book by the Urban Land Institute for a refresher.

471;Gilded Age was;"the time of the Great Depression, which led to the creation of the Federal Reserve. In the 1930s, there was a lot of talk about ""socialism"" and ""communism,"" but it was a term of opprobrium for the most part. The New Deal had made it possible for millions of working people to get a decent wage, and it was widely believed that this would be the end of capitalism. This was not the case at all. Capitalism was in a state of transition, and it was not going to die without a fight. The fight was to create a society in which workers and their unions were the dominant force in the economy, and in which the power of the state was curtailed to the extent that it could no longer be used to suppress workers' struggles. This meant that the government had to take a back seat to the working class and the trade unions as the key institutions of social control. It meant that the state was no longer"

(Darwin, 1859) It's no surprise that people with higher IQs are more likely to be successful in the workplace, as they have a better understanding of what is needed to succeed and how to get the most out of their time, energy and resources.

In my experience, this is the kind of book that people want to read, but not the kind of book that is going to change their life in the long run. I'm not a believer in the power of books to change people's lives, but I do believe that books have a power to inspire people to do good in the world and to be good people. The problem with The Gospel of Wealth is that it's not a book that you can put on your shelf and say ""here's my book of the week, this is what I'm going to read this week.""

476;What were the defining characteristics of the Gilded Age?;It was a time of economic expansion, when the United States was the world's largest economy. But in the 1920s and 1930s, there was a shift in the balance of power between capital and labor, which led to the creation of what we now call the Great Depression. How did it end? The Depression lasted from 1929 to 1933, and was followed by World War II in Europe and the Korean War in the Pacific. In the years after the war, many people lost their jobs, and they had to find new ones. But the economy continued to grow, and by the end of the decade, the U.S. had a much larger economy than it had at the start of the century. What was the impact of the Gilded Age on the country as a whole? The Gilded Age had a profound impact on American society, especially on African-Americans, who were the most vulnerable to its effects. It was an era in

483;Describe the way naturalist writers portrayed the fictional characters in their novels.;How many characters do you think were fictionalized in your fiction? The answer is a lot. There are so many that I'm not sure I can count them all, but I'd say at least half of them are fictionalized. What is your favorite fictionalized character and why? My favorite fictionalized character is the one who has no name at all. It's a little hard to explain, but I like that character for a number of reasons. First of all, he's the kind of character that makes me want to write a book about him. And second—and this is the most important reason—he's so good at his job. He's a detective, and that's a job in which you have to solve mysteries, and the detective's job is to figure out what's going on in a crime scene by looking at the evidence that's in front of him. So he's very good at that. And he's also very good
484;How did the efforts of Jane Addams and Mary Brewster help poor people in urban areas in the late 1800s?;"The answer is that they did not, at least not in the way we think of them. In 1887, a group of social reformers led by Addams began to focus on the problem of poverty in American cities and rural areas. Their goal was twofold: first, to help those who lived in poor neighborhoods; and second, to provide a means of escape from poverty that was not tied to the welfare state. The first step in this effort was an effort to organize the poor into ""families,"" which was a euphemism for ""councils of poor people."" These councils were organized around a common set of principles, such as the belief that poverty was a social ill, and that people had a right to be free from it. The second step was to develop a program of public works, including the construction of sewers, water mains, and streetlights. These were meant to improve the quality of life for the poor, and to make them"

Write a diary entry in which you describe your feelings about your children becoming Americanized while attending the local public school.;What's the most important thing you learned in high school that you wish you had known before you went to college? The importance of hard work in a business or profession is a common theme among college graduates. It's important to be self-motivated and work hard, but you can learn a lot about yourself by reading about people who have achieved success in their chosen fields. For example, the best-selling author John Grisham wrote an entire book about his experience as a student at Harvard Business School. In the book, Grisham shares his thoughts on what it takes to get to the top of the food chain and how he overcame a lack of confidence and confidence-shattering failures along the way. How do you feel about the state of education in the United States compared to other countries? I think the U.S. is one of the best countries in the world when it comes to education. We have a lot of talented people, and

It was released in 1993 for the Amiga, and the following year it was ported to the Atari ST by a team of former Microsoft employees who worked on the Xbox. In the years since, it has sold more than 10 million copies, spawned a TV show, and been turned into a feature film starring Kevin Spacey as the titular dog. But what is it, you ask? Well, for one thing, it's an open-world game in which you take control of a pack of dogs, which roam the city of Los Feliz in search of food (the food is in the form of dog food, of course). The story is told through cutscenes, and there's a lot of it, but it's not the kind of story that will appeal to everyone.

489;Interstate Commerce Commission was;"the first to regulate tobacco. In 1887, the Supreme Court ruled that states had the right to regulate the sale of cigarettes, a decision that paved the way for the federal government to take over the regulation of cigarettes in 1920. But that's not the only thing that has changed over the years. Cigarettes are no longer the ""gateway drug"" that they were in the 1960s and 1970s, according to Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard Medical School who specializes in smoking and health. Siegel said there are a number of factors that have contributed to the decline in smoking, including better information about the health risks of smoking as well as a shift in public opinion toward smoking cessation. ""We're in a period of transition,"" Siegel said. ""It's not just a matter of people getting out of the habit, but they're starting to think about it in a different way."" The Centers for Disease"
490;Explain how the Pendleton Act created civil service reform.;What is the purpose of the Public Service Commission (PSC)? The PSC is a statutory body established by the Government of Canada to provide advice and advice on public service reform to the Prime Minister and his or her cabinet. Its mandate is to advise the Prime Minister and cabinet on the implementation of the Public Service Employment Act and the Canada Labour Code (CLC), as well as other matters that relate to the public service. How many people are appointed to the PSC? There are approximately 2,000 members of the PSC, of which approximately 200 are appointed by the Prime Minister and the remainder are appointed by the Governor in Council. In addition, a number of positions are vacant at the time of the appointment of a member, which may result in the appointment of an additional member to the PSC. Who is eligible to serve on the PSC?

492;What groups and regions were strongholds for Republicans and Democrats in the 1880s? Where is their support today?;A lot of people have written about this, but it's hard to find a comprehensive survey that looks at the relationship between party identification and partisanship over time. I did my own survey of this in the early 1990s and found that Democrats were more likely to identify as Democrats than Republicans, but that was before the rise of the Tea Party, which is a Republican-leaning group. The data is a little sketchy, but there are a few things worth noting. First, it's not clear how much of the change in party identification is due to people moving from one party to another (as opposed to the other way around). Second, the changes are small, and they tend to come in waves rather than one-time events. For example, between 1881 and 1884, the number of Democrats in the House of Representatives increased by more than 1,000, while the number of Republicans in the House of Representatives decreased by about the same amount. In other words, the party
493;Why was the Sherman Antitrust Act ineffective?;"In a word, it was a mistake. The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 prohibited a company from engaging in anticompetitive conduct that harmed consumers, such as monopolizing a market or charging excessive prices. But that was not enough to protect consumers, who were left to fend for themselves against companies that abused their market power. As a result, antitrust laws were rarely used to enforce consumer protection in the post-World War II era. What's the difference between antitrust and anti-trust laws? An antitrust law is a law that enjoins a company from engaging in a particular type of conduct, while an anti-trust law is a law that enjoins a company from engaging in a particular type of conduct. For example, the Sherman Act prohibits a company from ""engaging in or conspiring to engage in any business practice or to fix any price, charge, rate, or other charge with respect to any article of commerce, or with respect to any transaction"
494;What similarities do you see between Cleveland’s inauguration ceremony and the ones we have today? Do you see any differences between the ceremonies then and now?;A lot of similarities. It's a beautiful day to be in the White House with the president of the United States. And I'm not going to get into the history of that, but there are a lot of similarities, especially in terms of the size of the crowd that was there, the fact that they had so many people in the streets and the fact that it was such a big event. The difference is that today, we have an inauguration that is much smaller in size and that's a good thing. It's a good thing for the country and it's a good thing for the people of this country to get their voices heard and have their voices heard in the way that they want to be heard. What is your take on the president-elect's decision to pick Mike Pence as his running mate? He's a good man, and I have nothing but respect for Mike Pence. He's done a great job in Indiana as governor and as a
495;Imagine that you are seeking a federal job in the early 1880s. Write a letter to your congressional representatives urging them to support or oppose the Pendleton Act.;If you have the time, go to the Library of Congress and look up the text of the Pendleton Act, which was passed in 1882. You will find that there is a lot of controversy over its constitutionality, but the gist of it is that Congress has the power to regulate railroads, but not the power to regulate private property. This is an important distinction, because it was the railroad companies that brought the law to the United States Supreme Court, and the court ruled that the law was unconstitutional. Now, what is your point in all of this? Well, the question is, why did Congress do this? And that is a good question to ask. I think it has to do with the fact that, at the time, the country was in the throes of a depression, and Congress felt that it was necessary to provide a safety net for the unemployed, and that was one of the reasons for passing the Pendleton Act. Another reason is
496;Ida B. Wells was;"a pioneer in the field of public health. She worked to improve the health of women and children by providing information and support to those who needed it. In 1887, the United States Supreme Court ruled that women had the right to control their own bodies and reproductive health, and that the government could not force them to have abortions. The decision was a landmark in the history of women's rights and the birth control movement. Wells' book, Woman's Burden: A History of Birth Control, has been translated into more than 30 languages and is considered the most comprehensive history of birth control ever written. The book includes a chapter on the American Civil War, which was one of the most important battles in the history of birth control. ""Ida B. Wells is an American icon,"" President Obama said in a White House news conference on April 4, 2013. ""Her life's work was dedicated to making sure women had access to safe, affordable contraception and the right"

He had an arrest record for drug possession in his hometown of Detroit, but the charges were dropped after he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and served three years in prison.

""As a law enforcement agency, we take all threats to public safety seriously,"" the statement said. ""The FBI has a long history of working with local, state and federal law enforcement to combat violent crime and protect the public, and we will continue to do so in this case.""

498;Explain what happened to Ida B. Wells after she began campaigning against lynching.;The story of Ida B. Wells is a classic example of the power of social media to change the world. In 1892, a woman named Ida B. Wells was working as a seamstress in New York's garment district when she heard about the death of a black man who had been lynched for stealing a loaf of bread. The next day, Wells went to the home of her employer, the Rev. William Folsom, and asked to speak to him about the case. Folsom, an abolitionist and member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), agreed to meet Wells and her husband, but when they arrived at their home, Wells was nowhere to be found. She had left the city the day before, and no one had heard from her for two days. Wells's disappearance sparked a flurry of speculation, and the police began to investigate. On the morning of July 2, 1892, a
499;Individual Action Why did Homer Plessy challenge a Louisiana law in1892, and what was the significance of his action?;Homer Plessy was a member of the New Orleans Bar Association, and had served as a justice of the peace for a number of years. On March 2, 1892, he filed a complaint against the City of New Orleans for the violation of the Louisiana Anti-Liquor Law (LAL), which prohibited the sale of intoxicating liquors to persons under 21 years of age. The complaint was based on the fact that liquor was being sold in the city, and that it was a public nuisance to the public, as well as to the plaintiff, who was a resident of the city. In his complaint, Plessy claimed that the city had failed to provide adequate facilities for the sale of liquor, and that this failure was the proximate cause of the nuisance. The court granted the complaint, and ordered the city to comply with the LAL. On March 9, 1892, the city was fined $1,000 and ordered to pay a fine of $
500;Examining After Reconstruction, why did many African Americans in the South live in conditions that were little better than slavery?;A lot of people have asked that question, and it's a good question to ask. The fact is, there were a lot of people who did not have the opportunity to go to college, and that was one of the reasons that the Civil War happened. It was a war of slavery and the abolition of slavery, and that's what was at stake in the Civil War. So, I think it's important to look at that history, and I think we need to be honest about the fact that we have a lot of work to do in terms of making sure that we're not perpetuating the legacy of slavery and the Jim Crow laws that were in place at the time. What is your take on the role of race in today's political discourse? Race is an important part of the political discourse in this country, and that's something that needs to be talked about. But the question is, how do we move forward from that and make sure that
501;Imagine that you are living in the 1890s. Write a letter to the editor of the local newspaper explaining your view of the Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v.;Ferguson (1896). What would you say in your letter? The answer to this question is a simple one: I would say that the Court did not have the right to make a law that was contrary to the Constitution. That is the answer that I would give in a letter to the editor of the New York Times. But what if you are a member of the media and your job is to report on the news? How would you answer the question? You would have to answer in a way that is consistent with the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and the press. The media is a public forum in which people have the right to express their views, even if they are unpopular. So if you are a news reporter, you would have to be careful not to use your position to promote a viewpoint that is not in the public interest. For example, in the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010), the Supreme Court ruled that corporations and unions
502;Anglo-Saxonism was;the result of a long-standing rivalry between England and the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex. It started in the 11th century, when King Alfred the Great (r. 1066-1107) was trying to gain control of the English language and culture, which had been in the hands of the Wessex kings for more than 1,000 years. Wessex, however, was an important ally of the English, and the two kingdoms fought a series of wars over the next two centuries. In 1066, Alfred's son and successor, Edward the Confessor (r. 1066-1137), defeated Alfred at the Battle of Bannockburn, and took the English language and culture for himself. But Edward had no love for the language and culture of his Anglo-Saxon allies, and he began to push for English to be taught in schools and in church sermons. By the end of the 11th

505;Pan-Americanism was;the most important of the movements that took place in the United States. The Mexican Revolution of 1910-1912 and the Mexican Revolution of 1910-1913 were the two most important events in the history of Latin America. Both of these revolutions had a profound impact on the world, as well as on the political and social life of the countries in which they occurred. The Mexican Revolution, however, did not lead to the end of imperialism, nor did it bring an end to the war between the U.S. and Mexico. On the contrary, it was one of the major factors in the intensification of the war and the rise of the Mexican bourgeoisie, which in turn gave rise to a new class of militarists, led by Chávez and his successor, Felipe Calderón. This class has become the dominant force in the Mexican state and is in the process of consolidating its power. The Mexican Revolution of 1910-1913 was a great victory for the working
506;Alfred T. Mahan was;born in 1887 and grew up in a working-class family. His father, a laborer, died when Alfred was a child, and the family moved frequently to work on the railroad, which was a source of income for the family. Alfred graduated from high school in 1902 and went to work for the New York Central Railroad as a locomotive engineer. After a year on the job, he was promoted to the position of engineer in charge of the freight service and became one of the most respected men in the railroad. In 1906, he married his high school sweetheart, Mary E. McCauley, and the couple had two children—Frederick, born in 1908, and Mary, born in 1910. The McCauley family was well known for its philanthropy, and Alfred donated $1,000 to the University of Chicago to establish a scholarship for women in the engineering field. The scholarship was named in his honor and is still in existence to this
507;Henry Cabot Lodge was;"the home of the Knights of Pythias (Knights Templars).

In addition, there is a room dedicated to the Order of the Garter, a group of Knights who were initiated into the Grand Lodge of England in 1745. The first Masonic Lodge in the United States was founded in 1848, and the first lodge to be incorporated as a non-profit corporation was the New York Lodge of Perfection, which was incorporated in 1851. In the 19th century, many of the lodges in the United States were incorporated as charitable organizations, such as the Masonic Charitableness Society, which raised money for charity by selling mementos of the deceased and giving them to the families"

512;Imagine that you are living in the United States in the 1890s. Write a letter to the president persuading him to support or oppose an imperialist policy for the United States.;In 1894, President Grover Cleveland signed the Tariff Act of 1894 which made it illegal for foreign goods to enter the United States without paying duties. The tariff was a response to the British East India Company (BEIC), which controlled a large portion of the world's trade. The British East India Company was the largest and most powerful corporation in the world at the time, and its monopoly was based on the fact that it had the right to import goods from any country at any time and for any reason it wanted. This meant that any country could send a ship to the United States and have it filled with goods, which were then sold to the U.S. market for pennies on the dollar. In other words, the British East India Company was able to make a profit by selling its goods to the United States at a lower price than they could sell them to other countries. The Tariff Act of 1894, however, did not apply to goods that
513;José Martí was;one of the most prolific writers of the 20th century. He wrote a total of 1,972 novels, short stories, poetry, and short stories between 1900 and his death in 1937 (the last year of his life). In addition to his work as a novelist, Martí was an artist, sculptor, and a painter. His works include a series of sculptures of the Virgin Mary, which were sold at Christie's in New York in the 1970s and are on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The sculpture of the Virgin Mary in the center of the sculpture is made of gold and has a crown of thorns on her head. The crown of thorns symbolizes the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in the Gospels and is a reference to the fact that Mary was crucified on Calvary, the cross that Jesus was crucified on. Martí is best known for his novel La Guerra de San Francisco, which was published in

The book was an instant bestseller, and Hearst sold more than 1.5 million copies in its first year of publication. Hearst's life was full of scandal, including a series of sex scandals that were the subject of a Pulitzer Prize-winning article in the New York Times on April 10, 1886. The Times reported that ""Mr. and Mrs. H. R. Hearst, of St. Louis, have been indicted for violating the act of 1887 which makes it a crime to have carnal knowledge of a child under the age of fourteen years and a misdemeanor to molest the same."" The charges stemmed from an incident in the summer of 1887"

The Pulitzer Committee awarded the prize to Pulitzer for ""the novel of the year"" and he accepted the award with a speech in which he called for a ""rebellion against the evil that is in the world,"" and ""the right of every man to be free from the yoke of slavery."" Pulitzer died of a heart attack on April 9, 1849, at the age of 52.

In his inaugural address, he called for a ""new spirit of community"" to replace the ""hierarchical, elitist society"" that had dominated the United States for the previous four decades. The New Deal was supposed to bring the country together, but it did the opposite. Instead of building a more democratic society, it turned into a system of class and race-based privilege, with the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. Roosevelt's legacy is one of the most destructive in American history. It has led to the concentration of wealth at the top, a widening gap between rich and poor, and an ever-widening gap between the haves and have-nots. The Great Gatsby, the story of a wealthy New Yorker who falls in love with a poor woman, is a classic example of this kind of inequality. But there is a silver lining to Roosevelt's legacy, which is that"
517;Platt Amendment was;the result of a long-standing dispute between the United States and its European allies over who should pay for U.S. arms. In the 1960s, the Soviet Union began to build nuclear weapons, which were a threat to the West. After the Cold War ended in 1991, the United States and its allies agreed to an arms-reduction treaty that called for the elimination of all nuclear weapons by 2029. But that was not enough to satisfy the Soviets, who wanted to keep a few warheads for their own use. In 1998, President Bill Clinton signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which included a provision that would allow the United States to sell up to 1,550 warheads to the European Union, Japan, South Korea (including the Republic of Korea), Australia, New Zealand, and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

It's hard to know what would have happened if Spain had gone to war with the United States in 1846 or 1848, but there is no doubt that the U.S. would have been in a much stronger position to deal with a Spanish-controlled Cuba than it is today.

521;Considering what you have learned about the Rough Riders and this battle, what is inaccurate about the painting? What kind of bias does this misrepresentation show?;"It is a painting of the Battle of Gettysburg, which has been misrepresented in the book and on the web. I did not paint the battle, nor did I have any part in it. The book, however, does have an accurate depiction of the battle, as well as a few inaccuracies that are in no way related to my painting. For example, in the book, there is a reference to ""two-hundred and fifty-two men of the First Cavalry"" who were killed in the battle, but this number is incorrect. The battle was fought on July 1, 1863, and not July 2, 1863. Also, the number of casualties in the battle is much higher than the number of men killed or wounded, which would have been a minimum of 1,000 to 1,500. In addition, the author of the book, John W. McPherson, states that he ""was a member of the 1st Cavalry, and had"
522;Imagine that you are a Filipino living during the time of the U.S. annexation of the Philippine Islands. Write a journal entry in which you describe your feelings about U.S.;"imperialism and the Filipino people. What is the most important thing you learned from this journal entry? 1. That Filipinos are human beings with a right to self-determination. 2. That the United States has no right to dictate to the Filipino people what they can and cannot do with their own country. 3. That there is no difference between a Filipino and a citizen of the United States. Why do you think this is important? 1. It is an example of what is known as ""interpellation,"" a form of communication that can be used to communicate a message to another person without the use of language. Interpellation is the ability to use language in a non-linguistic way, such as a sign language, that does not rely on the speaker's ability to speak the language in question. This allows the speaker to communicate with a non-native speaker without resorting to a foreign language. 2."

525;State what was provided for by the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution.;In 1868, the Supreme Court ruled that states could no longer deny citizenship to African-Americans who were in the United States before the Civil War. This was a victory for the abolitionists, but it did not end the debate over the meaning of citizenship. Some states continued to deny citizenship to those born in the United States, while others, such as New York, refused to recognize the citizenship of children whose parents were foreign-born. By the mid-19th century, the issue of citizenship had become a matter of state and local law, rather than federal law. In some states, citizens were required to swear an oath of allegiance to the state or its flag, and in others, they were required to pay a poll tax or register to vote. In the latter case, the state had the power to compel citizens to take the oath, but it was up to the citizen to decide whether or not to do so. As a result of these laws, many
526;How did initiative, referendum, and recall change democracy in the United States?;I think it's a combination of two things. One is the rise of the party system, which was the first time in American history that people could vote for a party and have that party control the government. That's what we have in this country, and it's a very, very powerful thing. The other thing is the way in which we have been able to get rid of the two-party system and create a third party system. What is the role of the media in this story? Well, there's no question that the media has played a role in helping to shape the public's perception of what's going on in the country. But I think the role of the media is not to tell the truth, it's to inform the public of what's going on in the country. That's what the media is supposed to do. How do you feel about Donald Trump's campaign for president? I'm a Republican, and I voted
527;What impact did Susan B. Anthony have on Progressive era reforms?;It's hard to say what the impact of Susan B. Anthony would have been on the reform movement, but there are a few things we can say with some certainty. First, she was a woman, and her advocacy helped make women's suffrage a reality in the United States. Second, she fought for women's rights and the right to vote, which were the first steps toward equal rights for women. And third, she had a strong sense of social justice, as evidenced by her work with the Poor Law League, which was one of the first organizations to provide legal aid to low-income women. How did she become the first woman to serve as president of the National Woman's Party? In 1881, a group of women in New York met to discuss the future of the party. One of the women in the group was Mary Pickford, who was the daughter of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. Pickford wanted to run for president, but she was
528;Under which system do voters seem to have the most control over department heads? Why do you think so?;A few years ago I was asked to give a talk on the history of police accountability in the United States. The subject was a little different than it is today, but there were a few themes that came up over and over again: the need for reform, the lack of trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve, and the fact that we have a system that is designed to protect the status quo rather than the public interest. It was an interesting and enlightening talk, and I'm glad to have it on my bookshelf. What is your favorite book on police accountability? The best book I've read on this is Michael Tooley's The War on Cops: The Abuse of Power and the Betrayal of America's Police Departments. Tooley's book is a must-read for anyone interested in the subject and for anyone who wants to understand what's at stake in this election. How would you describe the state of policing in
529;Some women in the early 1900s suggested that the Constitution needed an equal rights amendment. Imagine you are living then. Write a letter to the editor of your local paper supporting or opposing such an amendment.;In 1892, Congress passed the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which abolished slavery in the United States. This was a historic moment for African Americans, but it did not end the oppression of black people in the United States. Many of the laws that were passed after the Civil War continued to disenfranchise African Americans for the rest of their lives. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which made it illegal to bring slaves back to the United States after they were freed, remained in effect until the 20th Amendment in 1868. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 made it illegal for states to discriminate against people on the basis of race, color, or national origin in voting. But the Supreme Court ruled in Shelby County v. Holder that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional, and it was struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in June 2015. This decision is the first time in the

The fund's holdings include shares of General Electric Co., Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. In an interview, Sperling said he had no plans to step down, despite the criticism from his critics. ""I'm going to do what I have to do,"" he said. Sperling, a New York native with a bachelor's degree in political science from Columbia University, joined Goldman Sachs in 1990 as a research analyst and rose through the ranks to become chief investment officer, a position he held until his retirement in 2011.

""We're going to do everything we can to make sure this is a union that works for the people of West Virginia,"" he said. The mine, owned by Massey Energy, employs 1,200 full-time workers, according to the company's website. The company is based in Bismarck, North Dakota, about 100 miles north of Morgantown. Massey Energy spokesman Jeff Cargill said in a statement that the company ""does not comment on rumors or speculation."" ""Our focus is on the safety of our employees and the well-being of our community,"" he said. Cargill did not respond to questions about what kind of union would"
532;Hepburn Act was;a major step in the right direction. But it's not enough to make us feel better about the state of our health care system. We need to do more, and that means taking a hard look at what's going on in the private sector as well as the public sector. The Affordable Care Act, for example, created a system of tax credits to help low-income people buy insurance, but that was only part of the solution. The other part was to make sure insurance companies were required to cover people with pre-existing conditions and to provide coverage to those who could no longer afford it. These are the kinds of reforms that are needed to improve the quality of care and reduce the number of people who end up in emergency rooms because they can't afford the care they need. And it's important to remember that health care is a human right, not a commodity to be bought and sold like so many other commodities on the market. It's the right of every
533;Upton Sinclair was;"a pioneer of the ""race to the bottom"" that is the basis of today's corporate-state. In 1884, he wrote a book called The Jungle, which described the conditions of working-class immigrants in the United States. The book was an instant bestseller, and Sinclair went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1903. Sinapinos' views on race were not limited to the U.S. He believed that European immigrants were inferior to native-born Americans, and that the only way to improve the situation was to ""abolish the laws of nature and of nature's God."" Sinclair was an early proponent of eugenics, a pseudoscientific belief that human beings are ""sick and diseased"" and should be sterilized, as well as the idea that ""race"" was a social construct that had no basis in science. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other civil rights groups fought Sinclair"
534;Explain what was provided for in the Hepburn Act.;How many people have been convicted of a drug offence since the law was passed? There are more than 1,000 people in prison for drug offences, but the vast majority are serving custodial sentences. In the year to March 2015, there were 7,731 drug-related convictions in England and Wales (see table below). This compares favourably with other crime categories such as violent crime (11 per cent) and sexual offences (9 per cent). What is the most common drug offence? The most common drug offence is possession of Class A drugs, which account for more than half of all drug offences. This includes cannabis (47 per cent), cocaine (36 per cent) and amphetamines (34 per cent). Other drugs are used in a smaller proportion of drug offences than Class A drugs, but they make up a significant proportion of the total number of drug offences. For example, heroin is used in less than one per cent of drug offences,
535;How did Upton Sinclair contribute to involving the federal government in protecting consumers?;"Upton Sinclair was a pioneer in the United States of his time. He wrote The Jungle in 1851, a novel about life in New York's slums. The novel became a bestseller and helped popularize the idea of ""Negroes as human beings"" in the public mind. In addition to The Jungle, Sinclair wrote several other novels, including A Streetcar Named Desire (1853), The Jungle Book (1855), and the story ""Mules and Men"" (1856). What is the difference between a public interest case and a private interest case? Public interest cases are brought by people who have a legitimate interest in the outcome of a case. For example, an insurance company may be concerned about the health of its customers, and a consumer who wants to know what's in a product or how it's made may bring a public interest case to the attention of the government. In contrast, a private interest case is brought by a"
536;What impact did Roosevelt’s use of the Sherman Antitrust Act have on business?;A number of factors played a role in the growth of the U.S. economy, including technological advances in the manufacturing and transportation sectors, a rising standard of living for the middle class, and the creation of an international market for American products. However, it is important to note that these factors were not the only factors at work. In addition to Roosevelt's efforts to protect American industry from foreign competition, he also took a number of steps to increase the power of the federal government in the areas of labor and the financial sector. These included the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933, which provided a federal guarantee of unemployment insurance and created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which became the largest bank in the world in the 1930s. What was the impact of the Sherman Antitrust Act on antitrust enforcement? The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was one of the most important pieces of legislation in the history of the United States. It established a system of government

He is the author of several books, including A People's History of the United States (1902), The Jungle (1905), and the short story collection The Man Who Laughs (1906). His most famous work is The Jungle, which won the Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction in 1906. Advertisements
538;Joseph G. Cannon was;born in Nauvoo, Illinois, on February 6, 1844. He received his education in the public schools of that city, and was ordained an elder by the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1869. After serving as a missionary in the Far West, he returned to his home in Nauvoo, where he married his high school sweetheart, Lucy Mack Smith. The couple had three children, all of whom died in infancy. Cannon's life was marked by a succession of trials and tribulations. During the Civil War, he was wounded by a bullet fired by a Confederate sharpshooter, and his wounds required a year and a half of hospitalization before he was able to resume his work as a missionary. In 1869, he was called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which he served until his death in 1891. In addition to his ministry, Cannon taught Sunday School and was

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in its annual State of the Union address, said it would be ""disappointed"" if Congress did not act on tax reform this year. ""We are optimistic that Congress will take the time it needs to get this right,"" the chamber said in a statement. Trump's budget director Mick Mulvaney told Fox News' Martha MacCallum on ""Special Report"" that the White House is looking at ways to cut taxes for small businesses, which are the backbone of the middle class. Mulvaney said that ""there's no magic bullet"" to make that happen, but he did say that the Trump administration is working with Congress to come up with a plan that ""is going to help the American people."" ""It's not a silver bullet, but it's a starting point,"" Mulvaney said."

The 24-year-old had a heart attack on the way to a class on May 1, 2013 and was rushed to the hospital, where he spent the next three days in intensive care. Ballinger, who is black, said he was ""scared to death"" of what would happen to him if he was released from the hospital without a ventilator. ""I thought it was going to be the end of my life,"" he told ABC News' Good Morning America in an interview that aired on Tuesday. The hospital refused to let him leave with his wife and two children, and he was forced to stay in the hospital for more than a month before he was allowed to leave on his own.

I am an advocate for the conservation of wildlife and wild places. I have a deep love for nature and its many forms, and I believe it is my duty to share this love with as many people as possible. My work is a combination of education, advocacy, and conservation, and I hope to make it an integral part of the world's conservation efforts. Tell us about your background and how you got involved in conservation. Growing up in a small town in New York, I spent a lot of time on the water and in the woods. As a child, I loved to hunt and fish, and my father taught me how to use a bow and arrow.

542;How did replacing Roosevelt’s secretary of the interior cause a dispute between Taft and the progressives?;"It was a political decision, not a technical one. Roosevelt had been in office since 1909, and Taft had been in office since 1909—they were the same man at the same time. The progressive wing of the Democratic Party wanted to replace Roosevelt with a more progressive secretary of the interior, and that's what they did. How did Roosevelt react to this? Roosevelt did not like it one bit. In his memoirs, he said, ""I am the most conservative man in the United States, and this is my last election as president."" He was very clear about that. What was Roosevelt's relationship with Theodore Roosevelt Jr.? The relationship was cordial, but there were a lot of differences of opinion. Roosevelt Jr. was a great admirer of Teddy Roosevelt, and he would go to the White House on a regular basis to talk about policy, but they were not close friends. Why do you think Roosevelt's legacy"
543;What was the difference between Roosevelt and Taft regarding the relationship between the president and Congress?;Roosevelt was a more effective president because he had the support of the House of Representatives. Taft, on the other hand, did not have that kind of support. The House was divided, and there was a lot of talk about impeachment in the House. Roosevelt was able to get his agenda through the House, and that was one of the reasons he won re-election in '42. How did Roosevelt deal with the opposition to his New Deal programs? Roosevelt's policies were supported by most of the people in the United States at the time. But when it came to Congress, the opposition was much stronger than it was in the private sector. The Republicans controlled the House and the Senate, and they used their power to block Roosevelt's agenda. What was the most important issue that you had to deal with in your first year as president? The economy was in a state of crisis. Unemployment was at 10 percent, and the stock

546;New Nationalism was;"the name of a group of political and cultural movements in the United States and the British Commonwealth. Nationalism is a form of political and cultural identity that has its roots in the Enlightenment and its ideas of nationhood.[citation needed] The term was coined by Thomas Paine in 1776, and it refers to a belief in the superiority of one's own people over other peoples and to an ideal of national self-sufficiency, which can be expressed in terms of a ""commonwealth of nations"" or ""United States of Europe"".[1] See also [ edit ] Notes [ edit ] Further reading [ edit ] on this topic:"

But it was a great way to get to know the band, and they were great to hang out with. After that, I started to get a taste of what was to come in the years to come. I was introduced to a lot of bands that had the same sound and sound-alike, but with a different style of music. The first band I heard was The Misfits, and I fell in love with them right away. They were a punk band, but they had a punk-influenced sound that was very different from anything I had heard"

It created a debt bubble that was the largest in world history at the time, and the Federal Reserve has been responsible for that ever since (see chart below). Inflation and Debt in the United States As you can see, the debt-to-GDP ratio in the United States has skyrocketed since the 1970s, and that's not a good thing. It's a sign of a healthy economy, but it's also a warning sign that something is wrong. When you look at the chart below, you'll see that the debt-to-GDP ratio is at an all-time high right now: Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis This is the highest it's been since World War II, and it's been that way for a long time.

552;What new federal agencies increased the government’s power to regulate the economy?;In a word: Big government. The Department of Education, for example, is a government agency with the power to make it harder for students to get a high school diploma and more expensive for them to go to college. The Environmental Protection Agency has expanded its power to regulate air and water, as well as the food we eat and the chemicals we put in our bodies. And so on. What new federal agencies decreased the government's power to regulate the economy? There are a few, but they're small potatoes compared to the ones I just mentioned. One of the most important is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which regulates credit card issuers and mortgage lenders. Another is the Securities and Exchange Commission, which enforces securities laws, and a third is the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which protects workers from unfair labor practices. All three are government agencies that regulate business in one way or another. How do you know which agencies are big and which are
553;Which of Wilson’s reforms do you consider most important? Why?;"The first is to make it clear that there is no ""right to vote"" in this country. We have a right to vote for who we want to vote for, but that does not mean that anyone who wants to vote for a different candidate is entitled to do so. The fact that some people are disenfranchised is a matter for the state to deal with, not the federal government. I am a strong supporter of voter ID laws, which are designed to prevent people from voting in the first place. But I would like to see them expanded to include absentee ballots as well.

But I don't have a lot of time to think about that right now.

He scored a total of 28 goals in all competitions for the New York Red Bulls, including the game-winning goal in the MLS Cup Final against D.C. United on May 18, 2013. Villa's career was cut short by a knee injury in 2013 and he spent the 2014 season on loan with Chivas USA before signing with FC Dallas in January 2015. In his first season with FCD, Villa scored seven goals in 24 regular season games to help the club reach the Western Conference Semifinals, where they lost to Real Salt Lake in the Western Conference Championship. The 6-foot-2, 200-pound Villa has played in the English Premier League, Serie A, German Bundesliga, Spanish La Liga (Barcelona, Sevilla, Atlético Madrid) and Brazilian Primera División (Porto, Benfica, Sao Paulo). He is a member of the U.S.

In the preface to the book, Seward wrote: I have endeavored to make the Constitution as plain as possible, and have given every thing that may be necessary to enable the reader to understand it. It is my opinion that this book will be of great service to the public, and that it will serve as a standard of truth and accuracy in the interpretation of the Constitution and laws of the United States.

560;Zimmermann telegram was;"the first to mention the ""Germans"" in connection with the murder. On the morning of the 20th, a group of about a dozen German police officers arrived at the apartment, which was in a building with a German flag on the front door. The door was locked, and they had to break the window with a crowbar to gain entry. Inside, they found Zimmerman's body in the bathtub, with a bullet in his head. He had been shot three times in the head and once in the back of the head. The autopsy showed that Zimmerman had been strangled to death. Zimmerman's death sparked a firestorm of protest in the United States, with thousands of people taking to the streets to protest Zimmerman's acquittal and demand his prosecution for second-degree murder. The following day, President Obama issued a statement in which he expressed his condolences to the family and said, ""We are a nation of laws, and this case should have been"

563;How did European nationalism contribute to the outbreak of World War I?;It is a well-known fact that the French Revolution of 1789 was an anti-imperialist movement. In 1848, Napoleon Bonaparte declared war on the United Provinces of the French Empire (now France and the rest of Europe), which had been the most powerful nation in Europe for a hundred years. The war ended in a stalemate, but it did not end the war in any way. The Napoleonic Wars, as they came to be known, were a series of wars of national liberation waged by a small group of Frenchmen against the British Empire. The British Empire was a colonial power, and its military and economic power was growing at an alarming rate. The French, on the other hand, were an impoverished, underprivileged people living in a land of vast natural resources, where there was no need for war to protect them from the encroachment of foreign powers. Napoleon's declaration of war in 1848 led to the creation
564;How does the order in which countries declared war reflect the European alliance system?;It is important to keep in mind that there are two types of war: military and non-military. Military wars are fought by countries that have the right to self-defense, such as the United States, Great Britain, France, and Germany. Non-military wars are fought by countries that do not have the right to self-defense, such as the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, and Iran. This distinction is important for understanding the order in which countries declared war on each other. How does the order of declaration of war differ from the order of battle? In a military war, the enemy is declared to be at war with the country that declared war on it. In a non-military war, the enemy is declared to be at war with a country that declared war on it. The war declaration is made by the military commander and the battle is fought by the armed forces of the country that declared war on it. What is the difference
565;Imagine that you are a Mexican citizen living in Mexico between 1914 and 191;"Imagine that you are a Mexican citizen living in Mexico between 1914 and 191. The U.S. government wants to deport you because you are a ""danger to the public safety,"" according to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA).

What is the difference between a ""danger to the public safety"" and a ""national security threat""? In other words, how do you know if you are in the country illegally?

The answer is simple: you do not.

If you have been convicted of a crime that would be grounds for deportation, such as rape, murder, drug trafficking, etc., you are not subject to deportation. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule that are worth mentioning. For example, if you are an American citizen who has renounced your citizenship (and not a citizen of another country), you may be subject to deportation under INA 212(a)(3)(A), which provides that ""the Attorney General may deport aliens who are deportable on grounds of national security if the Attorney General finds that"

The following is an example of a script that could be used in this exercise: Hello, I'm a native Texan who lives in New Mexico. As you know, the United States is in the midst of a war with Mexico over who will control the border and how to pay for it. In my opinion, this war is unjust and has no basis in international law. I have no problem with Mexican citizens crossing the border to get medical care, but they should be allowed to do so without being detained or deported. My question is: What would you do if you were an American citizen and your home state of Texas was under attack by a foreign enemy? Would you stand idly by and watch as thousands of Mexicans were killed or maimed, or would you take action to help the people of your home state? Thank you for
567;War Industries Board was;a board of the U.S. military that operated under the direction of the Secretary of Defense. Contents show] History Edit In 2154, the United States military began to develop a weapon that could be used by the military and civilians alike, known as the AR-15. This weapon was designed with the goal of reducing the number of people killed in combat and to make it easier to carry in the field.[1] However, the weapon had a number of problems, including the fact that it was too powerful for the military and civilians to use, and that there were too many of them, especially in urban areas. This led to a large number of AR-15s being sold to civilians and law enforcement, who were unable to use them due to their power and size. In the years that followed, the number of AR-15s sold skyrocketed, and by 2077, it was estimated that there were over 1.5 million AR-15s

In an interview with The Associated Press, Liberty Bond chief executive David Tovar said he was ""proud"" of the company's record and that it was a ""good investment at a good price."" Tovar declined to say how much he paid for the bonds, which were sold in the United States and the European Union. Liberty Bond's bond sales helped it reach a record $1.5 billion in sales last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The demon is in the form of a man with a red-and-white striped suit, and he's standing in front of a church, holding a cross in his hand. The priest says, ""This is the power of Christ, and you are going to have to do this for me."" And this is what happened in my mind's eye: I was in the theater, and I looked at the screen and saw this man with a red-and-white striped suit, and he was holding a cross in his hand.

How do you think the war will be remembered in the United States? It is difficult to predict the future of the war, but one thing is certain: the war will be remembered as an event of great significance in the history of the United States.

In addition, there was a sense of moral urgency to prevent the use of chemical weapons in a war that was going badly for the Assad regime. As one official put it, ""We have no choice but to do what is necessary to protect the people of Syria, and that includes a military response to the use of chemical weapons."" This is the first time in the history of the Syrian civil war that the government has resorted to the use of chemical weapons against its own people. It is a stark reminder of the risks of relying on foreign powers to resolve conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa. What is the role of the international community in this conflict? The international community has been slow to respond to the crisis in Syria, and its response has been mixed at best. Some countries"
574;How did World War I cause the federal government to change its relationship with the business world?;In the 1920s and 1930s, Congress passed a series of laws that were designed to protect the interests of business and prevent it from being taken over by government. One of the most important laws was the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, which made it illegal for companies to engage in anticompetitive behavior. This law was a direct response to the rise of monopolies in the railroads and other industries, which were able to raise prices to drive out competitors. The Clayton Act also provided protection for consumers by requiring a monopoly to disclose its pricing and other information to the public in order to protect its business interests. But by the time World War I broke out, antitrust laws had become outdated and were no longer effective in preventing monopoly-like behavior. As a result, many companies began to move their manufacturing to other countries, where they were free to operate without government interference. This created a situation in which American companies had no choice but to rely on foreign labor and raw materials
575;How do these images encourage support for the war? How effective do you think they would be today?;It's hard to say because we're in a time of war, but the images of children dying in the war have a way of getting people to think about the war in a different way. They're not the same images that people are used to seeing in the news or on social media, but that's what's going on. I think that's a good thing. What are your thoughts on the use of propaganda in today's world? There's no question that propaganda is an important part of the propaganda war. It's very important to keep in mind that the United States is the world's largest consumer of propaganda, and we spend $1 billion a year on it. That's a lot of money, and it's not just the military and the intelligence community that are spending it. It's all of us. The American public is a big consumer of propaganda as well. So it's a big business for the media, and it's a big business for

The treaty provided for the partition of Poland, which was to be administered by the Russian government and the Polish government by the Czarevtskii (Polish government in exile) under the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit (1864). On the night of April 9, 1864, a group of Polish patriots led by Stanislaw Kowalski, leader of the Prussian army, attempted to break into the Russian embassy in Warsaw. The embassy was guarded by Russian troops and Kowalski was shot and his body mutilated in front of the Russian ambassador. The incident was one of the most serious incidents in the history of Polish-Russian relations. In the aftermath of the incident, the Russian government decided to withdraw its troops from Poland and, as a result, the Polish government was forced to sign the Brest-Litovsk Treaty. This treaty, however, did not solve the problem of Poland

It was an impressive performance from the home side, who were able to get a goal and two assists from their midfielders in the first half alone. The second half started with a bit of a slow start, but was much more of a fightback from the Toronto FC side. Toronto had their first shot on goal in the 22nd minute, but it was cleared off the line by goalkeeper Joe Bendik. In the 29th minute, TFC took the lead on a set piece goal from Sebastian Giovinco. The Italian striker took a pass from Jozy Altidore on the left side of the penalty area, dribbled through the Toronto back line to the top of the six-yard box, and slotted the ball into the back of the net to make it 1-0.

There are a lot of people who say that the French are going to pay for this war, but that's not going to happen. France is a country that has a long history of being the victim of foreign invasions, and they've been very good at keeping their borders open to the rest of the world. So, it's not as if they're going to have an easy time paying for this war. What's your take on Donald Trump's foreign policy? Do you think he's a good or bad choice for commander in chief?

The Committee was headed by Secretary of State Cordell Hull, a former New York Times reporter who had been appointed to the post on a temporary basis in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack. Hull's task was to ""prepare the way for the emergency,"" according to a White House memo of December 9, 1939 (PDF), and to ensure that ""no one is left out of the war effort, including those who have done nothing to warrant the suspicion of disloyalty.""

The Supreme Court ruled in 1878 that police could stop and frisk anyone they suspected of being a vagrant, and they had the right to do so without a warrant. But that was a long time ago, and it's hard to imagine a situation in which police would be justified in stopping a car full of people on the way to a grocery store, looking for a few dollars in the back seat, and asking the driver to step out of the car so they could search the car. That's not the kind of search that's going to turn up evidence of drug use, much less illegal activity. So what's the problem? Why are so many people afraid of being stopped by police in the first place? There are a number of reasons, but the most important is fear of the police. People are afraid to talk to the police, and that's a big part of the problem. The police are trained to use

The letter would be filled with praise for the war effort and a lot of good things about American life, but it would also say something like, ""You are a good American, but I can't help feeling that there is something wrong with you.""

Grant signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves in the South but did not end slavery in the North. This sparked a wave of anti-slavery sentiment that would last for decades. As a result, many Southern whites felt a sense of betrayal by the federal government, which had failed to protect them from the horrors of slavery.

The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (INA) established a quota system for immigration into the United States based on national origin (country of origin, not citizenship). This quota system was intended to ensure that the nation's immigration laws were fair and that those who came to the United States were able to assimilate into American society without being forced to leave their homelands for fear of persecution. In practice, the INA has resulted in a large number of immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean being allowed to immigrate to the United States, despite the fact that these countries have not signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of

597;How did the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act change the federal government’s role?;It is important to understand that the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment did not change the federal government's role in alcohol prohibition. In 1820, there were no laws against drinking in public, and it was legal to sell alcohol to anyone over the age of 21. By the mid-19th century, however, states began passing laws to regulate the sale and consumption of alcohol, and these laws were enforced by the federal government. In the years leading up to the Civil War, the United States was at war with Great Britain, and alcohol was a major factor in the war effort. As a result, many states passed laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol to soldiers and their dependents during the war. These laws were enforced by the U.S. Army, which had the authority to confiscate alcohol that was found in private homes and on private property. The government did not, however, have the authority to enforce these laws on the private market, which was the source of much of the
598;Why were immigrants from Mexico not included in the quota system set by the immigration acts?;A number of factors contributed to the exclusion of Mexicans from the quota system. First, Mexican immigrants were a small percentage of the U.S. population at the time of the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (INA), which set quotas for immigration to the United States. In addition, the Mexican-American population in the United States was growing rapidly, as was the Mexican diaspora in Mexico. Second, Mexico did not have a national identity and, as a result, many Mexicans felt a sense of belonging to the United States, even if they did not speak English or had no desire to become citizens. Finally, the Mexican immigrant experience was not a homogeneous one, with different types of Mexican immigrants living in different parts of the country. For example, the Chicano and Puerto Rican communities, which had been the focus of immigration legislation for decades, were not included in the 1965 act. What was the impact of the quota system on the number of immigrants
599;Imagine it is the 1920s. Write a letter to your senator to persuade him or her to either continue to support Prohibition or to work for its repeal.;You can do this by sending a letter to your state's senator or representative in the following format: Dear Senator or Representative: As a citizen of the United States, I am writing to express my concern about the harmful effects of alcohol on my family and the communities in which we live. My wife and I have been married for more than 30 years, and we live in a rural area of North Carolina. Alcohol is a major cause of domestic violence, and it has been estimated that one in five women will be the victim of domestic violence in her lifetime. In addition, the number of alcohol-related deaths in the United States each year is more than three times the number of traffic fatalities. I urge you to take a stand against this epidemic of violence and violence against women, and to do everything in your power to prevent the continuation of the prohibition of alcohol. Sincerely, Yours in Alcoholic Spirit This letter is an excellent way to start a conversation with your senator
600;Carl Sandburg was;"one of the most influential writers of the 20th century. His books were a source of inspiration for generations of writers, and he was the first to popularize the concept of ""literary nonfiction,"" which has become the standard for writing about the world today. In this interview, Sandburg discusses his work, how he came to write about war, and the future of fiction. What's it like to have a book published every few years? Do you get tired of writing, or do you keep writing? It's a lot of work. I've been writing since I was a little boy, and the books are written in my spare time. When I'm in the middle of a book, I'm writing, and when I'm not writing, I'm reading. So you have to be on the lookout for time, and you have to make sure you have a lot of time for your writing. How long does it take to write a book"

602;Ernest Hemingway was;"a master of this. In the first place, it's hard to get the word out of your head when you're reading a book, especially one that has been around for a long time. The best way to do it is to use a phrase or phrase-like structure, such as ""I think"" or ""This is the way I see it."" This helps people hear you, and it makes it easier to write the rest of the sentence without sounding like you're trying to say something else. Another thing to keep in mind is that you have to be careful not to overuse the word ""think"" in your writing. If you do, you're going to end up with a lot of words that sound like they're coming from the mouth of a madman. Instead, try to stick to one or two of the more common words for thinking, such as ""believe,"" ""analyze,"" etc. 3. Avoid the use of adjectives and"

604;Describe the main themes of artists and writers during the 1920s.;"How did you come to be a writer? I started writing when I was 12 years old. My father, an art dealer, took me to a bookshop in New York to look at a book called ""Art and the Modern World,"" by William Burroughs. The book was about the rise of art and what it meant to be a modern man. I read it for the first time at the age of 14 or 15, and that was the beginning of my love of writing. It was a way of getting out of the house and being in the company of other people who were interested in the same things I was—and that's how I ended up writing for a living. What was your first book of short stories, and why did you choose that genre? The first book I wrote was a story called ""Sleeping Beauties,"" which was published in the December issue of Harper's Bazaar. It was about a woman who had an"
605;How did writers, artists, and popular culture of the1920s affect traditional ideas in the United States?;"This is a question that has been asked for a long time, but I have been unable to find a satisfactory answer. The most important influence was the rise of radio, which was an immediate and powerful force in American culture. Radio stations played a large part in the cultural and political life of the country, and the influence of radio was felt not only in the country as a whole, but in every state and localities. In addition, there was the influence of Hollywood, which had its own radio stations and a large number of film and television productions. These influences combined to create a culture of mass media in which many of the ideas that had been held in the past were reinterpreted in a new light. This was the period of the Great Depression, and the Depression of the 1930s and 1940s is often referred to as the ""Radio Age."" How did radio affect the popular culture of the 1920s? The radio played an important role in the popular culture"
606;How did World War I influence the literature written during the 1920s?;It's hard to say because we're talking about a time in which there was no Internet, no social media, very little in the way of print publications. The most popular periodical was the New York Times, which was the first to publish a photo of a soldier in the trenches and the first to report on the war in a way that was not sensationalistic. It was a very different time than it is today. What was the impact of World War I on the literary world? I think it had a profound effect on the American literary scene, particularly in the early 20th century. The war was an important turning point in American history and literature. It brought to the fore the fact that America was at war, that the United States was a nation of immigrants and that we had to come to terms with that fact. That's what made it so important to write about the war and to be a part of the war-weary public. How
607;How do different elements of this piece work to convey a sense of isolation?;"I think it's the juxtaposition of the two, which is a little difficult to explain in a short interview. But I'm trying to find a way to get that to the audience that's not too heavy-handed and doesn't make them feel like they're in a room with a bunch of people that have no idea what's going on. What was your process for writing the music for this film? How did you come up with the themes and the mood of the film? I've done a lot of music in my life, but this is the first time I've written a score for a feature film. The idea was to make it a kind of ""musical odyssey"" that takes you on a journey through the music of the 20th century and the world of music in the 21st century. It's an interesting idea because you have this film that's set in the present, but the music is from the past. So I wanted to try"
608;Imagine that you have moved to New York’s Greenwich Village in the 1920s. Write a letter to a friend describing the atmosphere in your neighborhood.;"Describe the streetcars, the shops, the people, and so on. Now imagine that you are sitting in a restaurant and the waiter asks you what you want to order. You say, ""A hamburger with cheese,"" and he says, ""No, that's too much cheese for one hamburger."" What do you do? The answer is simple: If you want to be polite, you have to tell him that he's wrong. But that's not what most people do. Instead, they try to make him feel bad about his decision by saying something like, ""Well, I'm sorry to hear that. You know, it's a little hard to find a place that serves hamburgers with cheese on them."" In other words, people are more likely to apologize to someone who has wronged them than they are to apologize to someone who has done nothing wrong at all. This is called reciprocity, and it has been shown to affect everything"
609;Harlem Renaissance was;"the result of a long-term effort to revitalize the city. It began in 1848 when New York's mayor, Horace Greeley, began an ambitious plan to build a ""new city"" on the West Side of Manhattan. The city had been a poor, overcrowded backwater for most of its history, and Greeley wanted to change that. In addition to the new streetscapes, he wanted to improve the quality of life for the city's working class, who were suffering from high unemployment and poor living conditions. Greeley's plan called for the construction of public works projects such as the Erie Canal, which would bring water from Lake Erie to the city, and the New York Central Railroad, which would connect the city to the rest of the country. The first of these projects was completed in 1851, and the second, the Harlem Rapid Transit (HRT), began in 1853. By the end of the 19th century, more than"

611;Langston Hughes was;one of the most prolific writers of the 20th century. Hughes' novels are full of action, intrigue, and a love of the written word that can be hard to pin down in a novel, but that's the point. The plot is simple: a group of men travel to the South Pacific to find a woman who has been kidnapped by a group of cannibals. It's a simple premise, but Hughes has an eye for detail and a way of making it feel like a novel in and of itself. In the novel, we learn that the woman in question is the daughter of a wealthy merchant and his concubine, and that her parents are in a state of disarray, with one of the concubines dying of a heart attack while the merchant is on a hunting trip. The story takes place in 1885, and while there are plenty of references to the Civil War, the main focus is on the romance between the men and the woman they
612;Cotton Club was;"the first to use the term ""white privilege"" in its marketing. But it's a term that has come under fire from the Black Lives Matter movement for its association with white privilege, as well as other forms of racism. Cotton Club, which opened in the summer of 2015, offers a $1,000 prize to anyone who can prove they are white, according to the company's website. The prize is based on a survey of 1,000 people that found that ""over half of white people have never been to a restaurant with a black person in it,"" according to a press release. In the past two years, a number of companies have taken to using the term ""white privilege"" to describe their business practices, including Target, Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW). The term is not new, but it gained traction in the wake of the Ferguson, Mo., grand jury decision in 2014 that did not indict Darren Wilson,"
613;Marcus Garvey was;one of the most prolific scorers in the history of the NBA. He averaged 25.8 points per game in his rookie season, which led the league by a wide margin. His scoring average would be the highest of any player in NBA history until Michael Jordan's career-high of 27.8 points per game in 1988-89. Garvey was a three-time All-Star and won the scoring title four times. The 6-foot-10, 240-pound Garvey played for the Los Angeles Lakers from 1961-63 and the New York Knicks from 1964-68. He was an integral part of the Lakers' championship teams of the 1960s and '70s as well as the Knicks' dynasties of the 1980s and '90s. In addition to his scoring prowess, Garvey was a prolific rebounder, finishing second in the NBA in rebounding average (11.1 rpg) and third in rebounds per game (8

616;Describe the goals of Marcus Garvey’s Universal Negro Improvement Association.;"A group of Negroes in New York were trying to get the attention of the White Citizens Council, which was a white-owned organization. They had a lot of money, and they wanted to do something about it. The White Citizens Council said, ""You're going to have to pay for this, and we're going to take care of the rest."" So they started sending money to the Negroes, and it was like a snowball effect. The more money they gave, the more Negroes started coming to the meetings. What was the relationship between the NAACP and the Ku Klux Klan? There was a very close relationship between the two, but it was not a formal relationship.

How did the NAACP respond to the Klan's intimidation tactics? The NAACP did everything they could to keep the Klan from"
617;What actions did the NAACP take to expand political rights for African Americans?;The NAACP was a leader in the Civil Rights Movement, but it did not take a position on the Voting Rights Act until the mid-1960s. In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law, which required states to submit plans for voting changes to the Justice Department for approval. This was the first time in U.S. history that a federal agency had the power to approve changes to voting laws. The NAACP helped organize the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, which led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. What was the NAACP's relationship with the Ku Klux Klan? The NAACP had a long history of working with the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups. During the 1920s and 1930s, the NAACP supported the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), which was led by David Duke, a former Klansman who became a white supremacist after World War II. The NAACP also supported the Knights of
618;How did the Great Migration affect the political power of African Americans in the North?;It is difficult to say what the impact of the Great Migration was on the political power of African Americans in the North. There are a number of theories that have been put forward, but none of them are conclusive. One is that the influx of African Americans into the North was a response to Jim Crow laws that prohibited interracial marriage and the enforcement of those laws. This theory is supported by the fact that many of the most prominent leaders of the civil rights movement, such as Martin Luther King Jr., were of African descent.[1] However, it is also possible that the Great Migration did not have a significant impact on the political power of African Americans in the North and that they remained in the South for the rest of the twentieth century. In any case, the impact of the Great Migration on the political power of African Americans in the North was not as great as it was for other groups of American citizens. For example, the number of African Americans in the United States increased from
619;How did Duke Ellington create a new musical style that grew out of the ragtime tradition?;I think it's a combination of his love of music and his ability to write music that has a lot of soul to it. He was a very musical person, and that's one of the things that attracted me to him as a composer and a pianist. He had a way of making music that was very soulful and very melodeath-like in a way that you can't find in today's music. How did you get involved with Duke Ellington's music? I had a friend who was a music teacher at a high school in New York, and he told me about this guy named Duke Ellington. He was an incredible pianist, and he taught me how to play the piano and how to play the cello. I went to his house one day and played a few of his pieces, and it was like a revelation to me. I started listening to his music in the car on the way to school, and I was

He founded the Fund for Public Service in the 1970s to provide investment advice to government and non-profit organizations, and in the 1980s he co-founded the Social Investment Fund, which invests in social and environmental investments. The Fall family has been involved in philanthropy since 1885, when their father, Henry Fall, donated $1,000 to the University of Chicago to establish the Fall Institute for the Study of Labor and the Labor Movement. Henry Fall died in 1893, but his son and heir, Henry A. Fall, continued the family tradition of giving to the university and other institutions of higher learning. The Fall family's contributions to the University of Chicago, which is named in his honor, include a gift of $100,000 in 1913, the first of its kind in the United States, and a gift of $50,000 in 1914 for the building of the university's library.

Forty-six per cent (36%) of Canadians agree that ""it is the government's job to make sure things are done right,"" while 42% disagree. The remaining eight per cent (8%) are not sure. This is a change from last year, when a majority (55%) agreed with this statement. However, this has dropped to a low of 36% in the last two years, and is the lowest it has been since ARI began asking this question in 2006-07. When asked to name the most important problem facing the country, the number one choice was the government's handling of the economy (36%), followed by health care (25%) and crime (20%). Only one in five (20%) said it was the government's handling of the environment, and just over"
626;How did the Ohio Gang tarnish the Harding Administration?;"It was a group of Ohioans who wanted to change the name of the White House and the Lincoln Memorial to something more appropriate, such as the ""Hoover Dam"" or ""Tremont Dam."" In the end, the group got their way by a 2-to-1 vote of the U.S. House of Representatives, which passed the bill by a vote of 419-3. President Harding was a strong supporter of the bill, and it was his signature on the bill that made it into law. What was the impact of the Ohio Gang on the future of the United States of America? The name change was an important step in the history of the United States, and one that many historians consider to be the most important act of the 20th century. It helped unite the country in a time of political and social upheaval, and it gave birth to the concept of ""national unity"" as we know it today. How did the group"

In other words, there was no ""party of Lincoln"" or ""party of Taft,"" but a party of Wilson, Roosevelt, and Harding. What is the lesson of this history? I think it is this: If you want to win elections, you have to be the party of Lincoln and Taft. And that is what the Democrats have been for the last 80 years. They have been the party of the New Deal, the Great Society, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, unemployment insurance, public housing, the minimum wage, affirmative action, civil rights, women's suffrage, gay rights, environmental protection, and so on. The Republican Party, on the other hand, has been the party of the Gilded Age,"
628;Imagine you are a newspaper reporter during President Harding’s term. Write an article breaking the news of the Teapot Dome scandal.;What would you do with the information? A reporter would do two things: 1) Find out who the culprit was and 2) try to figure out how they got away with it. If it was a government official, they would be investigated and if found guilty, the government would be held accountable. If it was a private company, they would face the wrath of the public and their stock would be delisted from the stock exchange. In this case, the newspaper would have no choice but to publish the story and make it public. But what if the culprit was an independent contractor? Would that be newsworthy? The answer is no. If you are a reporter, you are in a position of authority and you have the right to tell the public what is going on. But if you are an independent contractor, you do not have that right. You are a subcontractor who works for a third party and your job is to do what the company tells you to do—that
629;Model T was;the first to use this technique. In the past, it was common to build a large-scale network of sensors that measured temperature, humidity, air pressure (in millibars per square meter or mB/m2), wind speed and direction, as well as light and sound levels. The sensor network was connected to a control system that could send commands to the actuators, allowing the system to adjust the size of the balloon and its shape to match the weather conditions. This method, called balloon-to-ground (BTG) communication, has been around since the 1960s, but the technology is still in its infancy. A team of researchers led by University of California, Berkeley, mechanical engineering professor John D'Esposito has developed a way to make BTG more efficient, which could lead to the development of more efficient balloon-to-ground communications systems. Their research is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
630;Charles Lindbergh was;one of the most famous aviators of the 20th century. Born in St. Louis, Lindbergh began flying at the age of six when his father took him to the airfield to watch a plane take off. He would spend the next four years learning to fly and, in his spare time, became a world traveler, visiting more than 100 countries in his first 10 years on the road. After returning to the United States, Lindbergh joined the U.S. Navy as a test pilot and served in World War II and the Korean War. In 1947, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his role in the Battle of Midway, which resulted in the sinking of the USS Hornet and the loss of 1,200 sailors.

634;How did the automobile impact American society?;In the 19th century, cars were the most common means of transportation in the United States. By the end of the century, the automobile had taken over as the most common means of transportation, accounting for more than two-thirds of all U.S. trips in 1900. In addition to providing a convenient means of transportation, automobile ownership increased the wealth of the middle class, and helped create a more equal society. What is the history of the automobile? The first automobile was invented in 1859 by Henry Ford, who built his first car in a Ford factory in Dearborn, Michigan. In 1871, a new type of automobile, the Model T, was introduced, and by 1875, there were more than 1,000 cars on the road in the United States. The popularity of the automobile was such that it was used to transport the first people to the moon in the 1960s and the first people to Mars in the 1970s. How
635;How did the United States government help spur the growth of the airline industry?;"In the 1930s, the government began subsidizing air travel, which was a way to get people to the West Coast and other parts of the country. It was an economic stimulus for the economy, and that's the way it should be in a free market. What's the most important thing you learned in your research? One of the things that surprised me was how little people know about the history of aviation. They're fascinated by the airplane, but they have no idea what it was like to fly a plane in the 1930s and 1940s. It's like a history lesson in and of itself. How do you think history will be remembered in the years to come? I think the best way to look at it is as a kind of ""what if?"" What if there was a government-sponsored airline that was able to compete with the private airlines? That would have been a great thing to have happened."
636;How did the growing consumer culture impact the nation’s economy?;In the past, there was a sense of consumerism that permeated every aspect of American life. We were the land of the free, the home of the brave, the land of opportunity. But the reality is that we have lost that sense of individualism, and that is a very, very dangerous thing to have in a country like ours. It's not just a matter of people wanting to be better than they were, but they want to be better than their parents and their grandparents, and that can lead to all kinds of problems. What are some of the problems that have come from this consumer culture? One of the biggest problems is the rise of debt. People are borrowing a lot of money to buy things that they don't need, and the government is subsidizing that debt with tax dollars. That's the biggest problem, and I think it's going to get worse over the next 10 years or so. The other problem is that we have

In a statement, the FBI said it was ""deeply saddened"" by Hughes' death and offered its sympathies to his family and friends. ""The FBI takes every threat against law enforcement very seriously,"" the statement said. ""We have a history of working with and sharing information with the FBI when there is a credible threat of violent acts against law enforcement officers, and this is no different in this case.""

642;What efforts did the United States make to promote permanent peace and worldwide economic recovery? Were these efforts successful? Explain your answer.;A number of factors contributed to the end of the Cold War, such as the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, and the end of U.S. involvement in the Middle East in the 1980s. However, it is important to note that these factors did not lead to a complete peace in the world. There were conflicts in many parts of the world, including the Persian Gulf, Central America, South Asia, and Eastern Europe. In addition, some countries were not able to overcome their internal conflicts and conflict over natural resources, which resulted in civil wars, insurgencies, and terrorist attacks. The United States continued to play a role in the international community, but its role was limited in comparison to that of other countries. For example, the United States provided humanitarian assistance to countries in the former Soviet Union, including Afghanistan, and supported the efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to establish a peacekeeping force

Alfred E. Smith, the father of this article, was born in New York, N. Y., March 3, 1849. After the death of his father, he went to the United States, where he worked as a carpenter for a number of years. At the age of twenty-one he emigrated to Wisconsin, where he was employed in the lumber business until his death in 1904. He had three children, all of whom survived him. The oldest of the children, Fred W. Smith, was born in 1876, and died in 1904. The second child, Mary L. Smith, was born in 1879, and died in 1904. The third child, George H.

In the past, Black Tuesday has been a day of trading chaos, with traders rushing to buy and sell stocks at the last minute. This year, however, the volume was much lower, with only a handful of trades making it to the wire. On Tuesday, there were just over 2,000 trades in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), the S&P 500 (SPX) and the Nasdaq Composite (COMP). That's down from more than 4,000 a day earlier, but still a record for the day. Related: How to get rich in stocks without a college degree The biggest drop was in the DJIA, which fell 1.4% to 1,788.

646;Hawley-Smoot Tariff was;"a major part of the ""war on coal"" that began in the 1970s. In addition to tariffs, the EPA imposed a series of ""regulatory burdens"" on coal-fired power plants, such as the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). These regulations are designed to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from power plants by requiring them to meet more stringent emission standards than they do today. The EPA has been criticized for its heavy-handed approach to regulating the coal industry, and the Obama administration has taken a number of steps to reduce the agency's regulatory power. For example, the EPA is proposing to phase out the requirement that coal plants install scrubbers to capture and sequester carbon dioxide, which is a major contributor to climate change. It is also considering the repeal of the TSCA, which would allow states to set their own air quality standards for coal-fired power plants."

648;How did the practices of buying on margin and speculation cause the stock market to rise?;It is a myth that speculation was the cause of the boom, and the boom was caused by speculators buying on margin. In fact, the market boomed because it was able to take advantage of low interest rates and a large pool of cash, which had been sitting in the bank accounts of savers for years. This pool of cash was used to buy stocks, bond issues, and other financial instruments at a time when there was no inflationary pressure in the economy. What is the difference between margin trading and speculative trading? Margin trading is the practice of buying and selling a security in the open market, while speculative trading is the practice of buying and selling a security in the closed market (i.e., when the price is below the bid or ask price). The difference is that margin trading allows investors to make a profit on the sale of a security, while speculative trading does not. How do you know if you are a margin trader?
649;Determining Cause and Effect Why did the stock market crash cause banks to fail?;"What is the relationship between interest rates and bank failures? How can we prevent another financial crisis? The Bank of England is the central bank of the United Kingdom. It has the power to issue money and regulate the banking system. In this article, we look at the role of the Bank of England in the crisis that led to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. The article is based on research by Dr. Peter Boettke, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. He has written a number of books, including The Bubble and Beyond: A Financial History of the World (Harvard University Press, 2008) and the best-selling Money, Markets and the American Economy (Oxford University Press, 2010). Dr. Boettke is the author of the new book ""Bailout Nation: The Making of the Unstoppable Financial Crisis"" (W.W. Norton & Company, 2010). This article was adapted from an article"
650;Note that decreased demand for automobiles ultimately led to layoffs. These layoffs further decreased the demand for automobiles. What do you think might have ended this cycle?;"A few years ago, I was asked to give a talk on the economics of car manufacturing in the United States. The topic was ""How to make cars that people want to buy"" and was based on my book The End of Automobile Production, which has been translated into several languages and is in the process of being made into a movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. In the talk, I suggested that there was a simple solution to the problem of low demand for automobiles: the government should subsidize the production of cars, which would in turn stimulate demand for other goods and services. This is the idea behind the government-financed car industry that we have today. But the problem is that the government is spending a lot of money on subsidies to automobile manufacturers and they have no way of knowing how much of that money is going to end up in the pockets of the people who make the cars. So what happens is that the subsidy is passed on to consumers in the form of"

This is a great way to build a name for yourself in the financial media and get your name out there to potential investors. Start a business, sell it, make a profit, and retire from the day to day hustle of running a business. If you are lucky, you will have the money to do this in your 70s or 80s.

653;Grant Wood was;one of the most prolific writers of his time. He wrote a book every two or three years, which is a lot of books to keep track of in the 21st century (and I don't know about you, but that sounds like a lot of books to keep track of, especially if you're a book nerd like me). His books were a mix of science fiction, fantasy, historical fiction, and non-fiction about the human condition. In addition to being a prolific writer, Wood had a knack for creating characters that were relatable to the average person. His characters had flaws, but they were human, and that made them relatable to a wide range of people. Wood was an avid outdoorsman, and he loved to hike, camp, and explore the outdoors. He wrote about his love of nature and outdoor activities in his book A Walk in the Woods, which was published in 1884. The book tells the story of a group of hikers who set out
654;John Steinbeck was;"a big fan of ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" the story of a family that moves to California to escape the poverty of New York. In a speech to the American Library Association in New York on Tuesday, Steinbeck said, ""I have a lot of sympathy for the poor and the dispossessed, but there is no place for poverty in the United States of America."" Steinbeck's comments come as President Donald Trump's budget proposes cutting $1.6 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides food stamps to low-income Americans. The cuts are part of Trump's plan to reduce the deficit by $54 billion over the next decade. Trump has called SNAP ""welfare"" and said it is a ""disaster"" for the poor, who rely on it to survive.

Faulkner's wife, the former Virginia Woolf, died of breast cancer in 1972. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Midway in the Pacific, which resulted in the sinking of the USS Hornet. ""It was a beautiful day, the sun shining and the air crisp and clean,"" Faulkner wrote. ""We were on the flight deck of the battleship, looking out over the Pacific. The ship was in a state of disrepair, but it was beautiful to watch it sail through the air and down the bay at full speed, with no one in sight to stop it."""
656;Explain what caused the Dust Bowl conditions on the Great Plains.;How did you come up with the idea of a world in which people are forced to live in the middle of nowhere? It was an idea I had in the '70s when I was a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles. I had a lot of interest in the environmental impact of agriculture, and how it was affecting the environment in ways that were not good for human health and the environment as a whole. So that's what led me to this idea of trying to figure out what would happen if you took all the land in the United States and turned it into a desert—that is, a place where there's no food, no water, no air, no sunlight. And then you have people living in the middle of it, and it's very, very hard to get out of there. What was the most difficult part of the project? The hardest part was getting people to understand that this was a serious problem and not some
657;Culture and Traditions In what ways did people seek to forget about the Depression?;A number of factors, I think. One was the economic crisis of the 1930s, which brought with it a wave of anti-capitalism and an attempt to re-establish the nation as a free market economy. This was the most dramatic of the Great Depression in terms of its impact on the American psyche and on the psyche of the people who lived through it. And it had a profound effect on the way people thought about their place in the world—how they saw themselves as part of a global community and how they were going to get out of the Depression. There was also a sense of national identity that was shaken by the Depression, as well as a sense of the country's moral and spiritual decline and the decline of the family as a way of life. The Depression also created a deep-seated belief in individualism, which was at the heart of the New Deal and the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and 1970s. People felt that they had no
658;Making Inferences Why do you think Life magazine was so popular during the 1930s?;I think it was a combination of the magazine's focus on health and the fact that people were looking for information that was not available in the mainstream media. Life had a lot of articles dealing with diet, exercise, the dangers of smoking, etc. The magazines were very popular in the '30s and '40s, but they were not the first to do this kind of thing. There were a number of magazines that did it before Life, such as Harper's Bazaar in New York, the Ladies Home Journal in New York, and Life and Home, which was published by the Hearst Corporation. These were the first of their kind, and they were very well-liked by the public. What was Life's relationship with the tobacco industry? Life was a big advertiser for Philip Morris, the company that was at the center of the anti-smoking movement. It was the first magazine to take a strong position against smoking and tobacco in general. The

660;Reconstruction Finance Corporation was;a public-private partnership between the City of New York (NYC) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY). In order to provide financing for the reconstruction of WTC 7, the New York City government issued $1.2 billion in bonds, which were backed by the proceeds of the World Trade Center (WTC) insurance fund. The bond issue was the largest in the history of the United States, surpassing the $1.1 billion issued in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.[1] As of September 30, 2008, there were more than $4.5 billion in WTC 7 debt outstanding.[2] On September 11, 2001, the WTC was destroyed by a plane that hit the north face of the building at 8:46 a.m. local time (1:46 a.m. EDT), resulting in the collapse of the building.

This was a result of the War on Terror, which required the Army to be ready to deal with terrorist threats in the wake of 9/11 and the Iraq War in 2003. The Army also had the opportunity to train new recruits in the use of military-grade weapons and equipment, and was able to do so"
662;Summarize three major initiatives taken by Hoover to improve the economy and the results of each.;Hoover was a proponent of free trade in the 1920s and 1930s, which led to the growth of the U.S. economy. He believed that a nation's prosperity depended on the ability to trade with other nations and was not limited to goods and services that could be shipped across state lines. In his time, the United States had no trade agreements with foreign countries, and trade was a major source of employment for millions of Americans. Hooverturf, a term coined by Hoover, was an effort to create a network of free trade zones throughout the country. These zones were designed to allow businesses to sell their wares at lower prices in exchange for a tax credit from the government. This was a way of making it easier for small businesses to expand and hire new workers without having to worry about competition from foreign-owned businesses. The idea was to encourage the creation of new business, and it did work, as businesses began to open in the early 20
663;What did business leaders promise Hoover they would do to help the economy? Did they keep their promises?;"Hoover's response was simple: ""No, I did not promise anything."" But that was the end of the story. The Hoover administration was in the midst of a crisis of its own making, and its policies were to blame for the Great Depression. In the months and years that followed, Hoover and his advisers tried to make amends, but it was too late. By the time Franklin D. Roosevelt took office in 1933, the United States was on the road to economic and political obloquy. What was Hoover's legacy? He left an enduring legacy of government overreach, a policy of ""stimulus"" that created a false sense of prosperity and led to the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Hoover's legacy is one of the most important in American history, and it deserves to be remembered for the good it did and the mistakes it made.

664;How did President Hoover’s philosophy of government guide his response to the Depression?;"Hoover was a pragmatist, not a doctrinaire ideologue. In fact, he did not believe in the infallibility of government, but in the need for a government that was ""in the business of doing what is right, not what is expedient."" The Hoover-Roosevelt New Deal differed from the Roosevelt-Nixon New Deal in that it was based on an economic program rather than a political program. The New Deal, however, had a much more radical agenda, as evidenced by the ""three pronged attack"" on labor, the minimum wage, and Social Security: to ""abolish the income tax, the national bank, unemployment insurance, and all forms of social insurance,"" and to create a ""National Monetary Commission"" to ""examine the possibility of nationalizing the gold standard.""

The dairy industry is a multi-billion dollar industry and has grown to the point where there are over 1,000 dairy farms in the United States. These farms produce milk for human consumption, but also for animal feed (milk is the most profitable part of the dairy industry, accounting for more than 90% of the industry's revenue). The milk produced by these farms is used to feed animals that are raised for meat and other products. These animals are fed a diet rich in corn, soy, and other grains, which in turn cause them to grow fat and gain weight. This is known as grain-fed livestock, or G.F.L. Livestock. G.F.L. livestock have been shown to be at risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and other health problems.

But that's not the end of the story. The Senate also passed a bill that would allow states to opt out of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, which is one of the most popular parts of the law. This means that millions of low-income people will lose health insurance if they live in states that refuse to expand Medicaid. The bill passed in the Senate by a vote of 51-49, with Republicans voting against it because they wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement in place.

After a stint in the U.S. Senate, he ran for governor of New York in 1892 as a Republican and won the governorship by a margin of more than 1,000 votes. In the presidential election of 1896, Roosevelt defeated Democratic incumbent Grover Cleveland in a landslide, becoming the first African American to win the White House. What is the most important lesson you learned from your childhood that you apply to your work today? It's a question that comes up a lot in my work: How do you build a community and make people feel good about their place in the world? I think one of the most important things I learned growing up was that people are the most important thing in the world. You have to be willing to take care of people, even if that means making them feel bad about themselves. That's the kind of person you want

672;How did FDR’s experiences as governor of New York prepare him for the presidency?;"He was a New Yorker, so he had a lot of experience in that part of the country. I think the most important thing for him to know was how to deal with the media, which was a very different thing from what he had done in New York. He had done a lot of media work, but it was very different from the kind of media work that he was used to doing in New York. What was it like to go to the White House for the first time? It was an amazing experience. The first time I went to the White House, I was in my 20s, and there were a lot of people who were my age and younger than me. I remember thinking, ""This is going to be the most fun I've ever had in my life."" And it was. It was a lot of fun, and we had a lot of fun doing it. How did you get the job of vice president of the United States"
673;Imagine you are living during the Depression. In your hometown, there has been a bank run. Write a letter to the president describing this event.;"The president will read your letter and say, ""Well, that's the way it is in the United States of America. I'm sorry to hear that, but it's the way it is."" Then he or she will give you a $10,000 check for your trouble. This is a story that has been told many times in the history of the United States. But what is different this time is that the money is going to a charity that is fighting poverty in the inner city. The charity is the Salvation Army, and they have set up a fund to help those who need it the most. It's called the Giving Pledge, and it was started by President Bill Clinton in 1993. He wanted to do something about the fact that people were getting rich off the backs of the poor, and he thought it was time to take a stand against that. So the president signed a law that said if you make more than $250"
674;American Liberty League was;"founded in 1871 to promote the interests of ""liberty, justice, and property."" The group has a history of pushing anti-Semitic and white supremacist propaganda, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). In a press release, the SPLC said, ""LOLL's mission is to expose the lies, distortions, exaggerations, and false claims that have been propagated by the Jewish-controlled media and their political enablers in order to destroy the United States of America and all who live under its protection."" The group is known for publishing articles such as ""The Jews are behind 9/11,"" which claimed the World Trade Center was brought down by Jews who wanted to ""take over the world."" ""We believe it is our duty to expose the Jews for what they are, and that is a bunch of liars, deceivers, hypocrites, and traitors,"" one of the group's founders, David Duke, said"
675;Works Progress Administration was;"a government agency in the United States. Contents show] History Edit The WPA was created by Franklin D. Roosevelt to provide jobs for the unemployed during the Great Depression.[1] In 1933, the agency began its work in New York City, and by the end of the year had expanded to other cities across the country and the world as well. The WPA's work was primarily aimed at the construction of public works projects, such as roads, bridges, water mains, sewers, and other infrastructure. However, it also had a number of other projects in the works, including the creation of a ""National Bureau of Standards"" for the use of the public to make recommendations on construction and maintenance of public works projects and the establishment of the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC), an organization that would serve as the forerunner of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the U.S. Department of Commerce (USDC).

676;National Labor Relations Board was;"created in 1935 to protect workers' rights. The NLRB has the power to strike, but only if it has a majority of votes in the bargaining unit, which is called a ""representative body."" In other words, the union must be represented by at least one union member from the bargaining unit. A strike is a form of collective action in which workers go on strike to demand a wage increase or other changes in working conditions. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) was passed in 1935 to provide workers with a legal way to organize a union and bargain collectively with their employer. What is a strike? A strike is an organized effort by workers to stop work at a company or an individual employer, or both. It can take many forms, such as picketing, sit-ins, walkouts, and other forms of non-work activities. When does a strike occur? Strike dates vary by state, but generally occur between"
677;Contrast the ideas of Father Charles Coughlin, Senator Huey Long, and Dr. Francis Townsend.;"In a letter to the New York Times on March 23, 1884, Coughlin wrote: I am a Catholic, and believe the Bible to be the word of God. It is my duty to tell the truth, and if I have any fault to find with any part of it, it is in the teaching of the Catholic Church, which has been the cause of so much evil in the world. Long, the founder of the Ku Klux Klan, was an anti-Semite and a proponent of eugenics, the belief that the best way to prevent disease was to sterilize as many people as possible. Townsend's views were far more extreme than those of Coughlin, and he believed that Jews were responsible for the Great Depression of the 1930s and blamed it on their ""filthy habits of debauchery"" and ""slavery."" These are just a few of the more extreme examples of what is known as the ""white"
678;How did the New Deal contribute to the growth of industrial unions?;It's hard to say because we have no data on the extent to which unionization was a factor in the economic growth of the 1930s and 1940s. But there is a lot of evidence that unions played a role in creating a more stable labor market, which in turn led to higher wages and better working conditions for workers. What was the impact of the New Deal on the American middle class? The Great Depression was a major blow to the middle class. In the years leading up to the Depression, wages were stagnating, unemployment was high, and people were working longer hours for lower wages. But by the end of the 1930s, the economy was starting to recover and workers were getting a better deal. That's what made it possible for people to buy homes, start businesses, and take care of their families. How did the New Deal help workers in the private sector? The government provided a safety net for those who lost their jobs,
679;Why is the Social Security Act an important piece of legislation?;It is a very important piece of legislation because it has the potential to change the lives of millions of Americans who are living below the poverty line. The Social Security Act provides benefits to people who have worked a set number of years and are retired, and it is designed to be a safety net for those who need it the most. In other words, it is designed to help people get out of poverty if they fall on hard times. What is the difference between a disability and a retirement benefit? Disability is a term that is used to describe the inability to work because of a physical or mental impairment that prevents you from doing your job. Retirement benefits are defined as the amount of money that you receive after you reach age 62 or if you are no longer able to work due to age, illness, or disability. How much does Social Security cost? The cost of Social Security is $2.7 trillion a year, or more than a quarter of
680;How did successful strikes such as the sit-down strike shown in the photograph lead to a rise in union membership? Political Challenges;"to Unions What is the relationship between unions and the Democratic Party? How do unions relate to labor's political and economic power? The Labor-Industrial Relations Act of 1935 (LIRA) was passed by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935, a joint effort of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress. The LIRA created a system of collective bargaining for private-sector workers, and it was intended to replace the traditional ""right to work"" laws that had been in place since the 1930s. In addition to providing protection for workers who wanted to form unions, the LIRA also gave unions the right to collect dues from their members in order to fund political activities, such as election campaigns. This new right to organize, along with the right to bargain collectively, led to the formation of the AFL-CIO in 1935, which became the nation's largest labor federation by the end of World War II. As a result of the labor movement's"

682;Frances Perkins was;a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from New York. She died of breast cancer in 2010 at the age of 92 The first thing you notice about her is her hair, which is auburn. She wore it long in the '50s and '60s, when the hairstyle was popular in the United States. But by the '70s, it was the fashion of the day, and her hair had grown to the point where it covered her face. 'I had to shave every day,' she said. 'And I was very, very strict about it. I would have a razor in my hand and I would go to the bathroom, put the razor down on the sink, and I would wash my hair and put it in a ponytail.' Perkins, who was born in St. Louis, Mo., grew up in a middle-class family, with her father working as a carpenter and her mother as a hom
683;court-packing was;a big part of the team's success. In the past, it was easy to forget how much of a team the Lakers had become after Kobe's retirement in 2008-09. They were one of the best teams in the Western Conference, and the only team to win at least 50 games in each of the past three seasons. But with Kobe gone, the Lakers have fallen off the map a bit. Their record this season is a mediocre 29-48, good for sixth in the West. That's not to say there's no hope for Los Angeles, of course. The Lakers have a lot of talent on the roster, and they could make a run at the top of the West if they play their cards right. But it's going to take a lot of hard work, and patience, to get to that point. Here's a look at the Lakers' roster, as it stands now: Point Guards: Steve Nash, Jordan Farmar, D
684;Henry Morgenthau was;a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Morgenthau's brother-in-law, Henry Cabot Lodge, served as Secretary of State under President John F. Kennedy from 1961 to 1963. In addition to his work on foreign policy, Morgenthau was an expert on the history of science and technology, and a prolific writer of history and biographies of famous scientists such as Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) and Albert Einstein (1879-1955). The following is a list of his most notable works: A History of the United States by James H. Loewen (1906) The American Century: An Economic and Sociological History by Robert M. Hutchins (1907) America's Place in the World by John J. McCloy (1908) The Great American Novel: A Study of the Novel as a Social and Political Art by Henry C. B
685;John Maynard Keynes was;"a man of the left. In the 1930s and 1940s, he wrote a book called The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936, with Lionel Robbins), which laid out the foundations of Keynesian economics. Keynes's ideas were so influential that, by the end of the 20th century, the word ""Keynesian"" had become synonymous with economic theory, even though it was a little-known economist who wrote the book. But what is it about Keynes that makes him the most popular economist of all time? Why is he considered to be one of the greatest economists of all time? Here are five reasons to learn more about Keynes: 1. He predicted the Great Depression of the 1930s and the rise of Nazism in World War II. The first thing you need to know about Keynes is that he was an optimist. He believed that a world in which people worked to produce wealth would be a better world than one in"
686;Explain Roosevelt’s court-packing plan and how it was received.;"What was the most difficult part of the court-packing plan? I think the most difficult part was to get the Supreme Court to agree to hear the case. It took a lot of work, but we were able to get the court to agree to hear the case in the summer of 2006. The court had been reluctant to hear the case, but after hearing the case, they said, ""This is a good case for us to hear."" How did Roosevelt's plan differ from that of other justices? Roosevelt's plan was a little different because, as you know, there were two justices on the court at the time, Justices Scalia and Breyer. They were the most conservative of the four and the two most liberal justices were the other two justices. So Roosevelt wanted to make sure that the court was divided in terms of ideology, which is a big deal in the court. What were the biggest problems with Roosevelt's plan?"
687;What groups made up the New Deal coalition?;In the 1930s and 1940s, a number of labor unions were part of the coalition, including the American Federation of Labor (AFL), the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU), the United Automobile Workers (UAW), and the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). These unions had strong ties to the Democratic Party and supported Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs. The AFL-CIO, for example, was a member of the Roosevelt administration's Council on Industrial Relations (CIR), which helped draft the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 and the Works Progress Administration (WPA), which provided unemployment insurance and other social welfare programs to the working class. During World War II, the AFL-CIO and other labor unions joined with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in a coalition to fight the war in defense of the capitalist class. This coalition included the American Federation of Labor (AFL), the American Federation of State, County
688;How did the New Deal change attitudes toward government?;A number of factors played a role in the rise of the welfare state, including the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II. In the early 1930s, unemployment was high and wages were low, making it difficult to get a job. Many people felt their lives were in shambles, and a sense of hopelessness pervaded the country. The government stepped in to fill the gap, providing cash benefits to those who needed them and a safety net for the less fortunate. This was an important step toward social mobility, which had been a goal of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. What was the impact of the New Deal on the labor movement? Labor unions were the first to take advantage of the New Deal's benefits and safety net. As a result, the number of union members increased from less than 10 percent of the working-age population in 1933 to more than 30 percent in the mid-1940s—a dramatic increase in a short
689;What does it suggest about Roosevelt’s method of campaigning?;In a word, it suggests that he was a master of propaganda. The Roosevelt campaign had two main objectives: to win the support of working people and, at the same time, to make it appear that the New Deal was a government program that had been put into effect by the government, rather than an outgrowth of the capitalist system. This was a clever way of getting people to believe that they were in the driver's seat of the nation's economic and social life and that their interests were the same as those of the people as a whole. What was the effect of this on the public? It was an enormous success. Roosevelt's popularity soared to the highest levels of any president in American history, and he became the most popular president since Woodrow Wilson. The public's belief in the government's ability to do something about the problems of the day was such that it did not matter how many times he tried to tell them that it was not their problem, but

691;Benito Mussolini was;a fascist. In the 1930s and 1940s, the United States and other Western countries imposed sanctions on Nazi Germany, and in the early 1950s, the Soviet Union imposed economic sanctions on the Nazi regime. But these sanctions were ineffective, and the Nazis continued to gain power and expand their power throughout the Cold War. As late as the 1990s, there was a debate about whether or not to lift the sanctions, which had been in place for more than two decades. The debate was sparked by the assassination of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1998, which brought an end to the rule of the military junta that had ruled Chile since the country's independence from Spain in 1811. After the coup, the U.S. and other Western countries began to support democratically elected governments in Latin America and the Caribbean, such as the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Panama. These governments were able to establish free and fair elections, and many
692;Vladimir Lenin was;"the founder of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In a speech to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) on July 25, 1917, Lenin said: ""We have no need of a party to carry out the tasks of the revolution, for it is the working class which is the party of the revolution. The dictatorship of the proletariat is the dictatorship of the proletariat and not of the bourgeoisie."" Lenin's words were taken to heart by the Bolsheviks and they adopted them as the basis of their party organization. The Bolshevik Party was born in October 1917 as a result of the split between the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries (SRs), which resulted in the formation of the Provisional Government of Petrograd in February 1918. The Bolsheviks took the name of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (Bolshevik) to distinguish themselves from the Mensheviks and SRs. After the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks"
693;Joseph Stalin was;"a master of propaganda. In the 1930s and 1940s, he created a series of ""propaganda films"" to show the horrors of the Great Purge, which took place in the Soviet Union between 1937 and 1939. The films were made in secret, and only a handful of people were allowed to see them. One of these films, ""Stalin's Secret Film,"" has been viewed more than 100 million times on YouTube since it was uploaded in 2012. The film shows Stalin's henchmen and other government officials in a state of panic as they try to figure out what to do about the millions of ""enemies of the people"" who had been rounded up during the Stalinist purges. But there's a problem with this film, according to a study published last year in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. The researchers found that people who watched the film were more likely to believe that Stalin was a good leader than those who did not. This"
694;Adolf Hitler was;"a fan of The Wizard of Oz. In the film, Dorothy's house is filled with ""wonderful things,"" such as a golden apple that gives her strength and the Scarecrow's ruby slippers that make him invisible. But there's one thing that's missing: a magic mirror. Hitler had an obsession with the movie, according to a report in the New York Times. The Nazi leader would go to great lengths to watch it on his big screen TV in his office at the Chancellery in Berlin. ""I have a very strong feeling that this is the most important movie of all time,"" Hitler said in an interview with a German film critic, according to the Times. ""It will make the world a better place, and that is my dream."" Hitler's obsession with The Wizard of Oz was so great that he ordered his wife, Eva Braun, to make a copy of the movie for him. The film was a box office"
695;Manchuria was;the first to use it. In 1878, a group of Chinese and Mongolian traders from Chiang Kai-shek's China-Mongolia (CMA) Trading Company set up a factory in the city of Tientsin, which became the first Chinese-maintained factory in the world. The factory produced silk and other textiles for the CMA, as well as a variety of other goods, including shoes, shoeshine, and clothing. By the end of the 19th century, China had developed an industrial-technological base that would make it a major player in the world economy for the next two centuries. The Chinese were able to export their goods to the United States, Europe, South America, and other parts of the world at a rapid pace, and they did so without the need for tariffs or import quotas. In fact, China's trade with the world reached $1.5 billion in 1900, more than any other country at

In the United States, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and other Jewish groups lobbied to pass the Neutrality Act of 1933, which prohibited the government from interfering with the right of Jews to worship as they saw fit. The bill passed the House of Representatives on March 1, 1933, but was vetoed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who said it would lead to ""unwarranted interference in the affairs of private individuals and organizations."" ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching!

698;What events caused President Roosevelt to become more of an internationalist?;The United States entered World War I in 1917 with the intention of winning the war, but in the course of the war they were forced to take a neutral position. This was a very difficult decision for the American people to make, but it was the right thing to do at the time. The war was going badly, and there was no way to stop it. So the U.S. had to do something, and that was to get out of the war as quickly as possible. What was the reaction of the British to this decision? The British were very upset, and they did not want to be seen as the aggressors. They wanted to stay neutral, and they did not want to be seen as supporting the war in any way. So they tried to make it look like the Americans were going to attack them, and that's what they did. How did this play out in the international relations of the time? The British and the

Why do democracies have a tendency to become dictatorships? How can we explain the rise of authoritarian regimes in Latin America and the Middle East? The Origins of Democracy in the United States The American Revolution was a turning point in the history of democracy in the United States. In 1776, the British Parliament passed the Declaration of Independence, which declared that ""all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" This was the first time in American history that a government had asserted the right to rule by majority rule rather than by direct election of a monarch as had been the case in England for the previous 200 years. The Declaration and the Constitution established the rule of law as the foundation of American democracy. The first president of the United States, George Washington, wrote in his Farewell Address that """

This is a good idea, but it has been tried and it failed miserably. Trump's election has given us a chance to do something different. The question is whether we are going to seize it."
701;Shoah was;"the most powerful of the Holocaust. It took place on April 24, 1945, when the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union in an attempt to crush the Red Army, which had been fighting for independence from the Nazi-dominated Soviet Union since World War II. More than 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, most of them by the Nazis and their accomplices in the Soviet Union. The Shoah, or catastrophe, was one of the darkest chapters in the history of the Jewish people. In his book, Holocaust: A Biography, historian David Remnick writes that ""the death of the Jews of Europe is a dark chapter in human history, and one that will be remembered for generations to come."" Remnick, a New York Times best-selling author of The Last Judenrat, a book about the Jewish resistance during the Holocaust, told NBC News that he was inspired to write the book after reading an article in the Washington Post about the book"
702;Nuremberg Laws was;"the name of a law passed in Nuremberg, Germany. It prohibited the wearing of Nazi insignia and the promotion of Nazism in public and private life.[1] Contents show] History Edit The Nuremberg Laws were a series of decrees that were passed by the Nazi government on April 30, 1933, after the Nazis took power in Germany. The first of these decrees was the Reichstag Fire and Water Code of 1933, which stated that Jews were to be exterminated, as well as anyone who ""offends the feelings of the majority of the German people"" (i.e. the Nazis). In addition, the Nazis were to ""abolish the National Socialist Party and all its organs and organizations, which are inimical to the German people and to the Reich.""[2] The second Nuremberg decrees, issued on May 1, 1933, declared that ""any Jew who does not want to live in a state"
703;Wannsee Conference was;a meeting of the heads of the SS and Gestapo in Potsdam. It took place on the 2nd and 3rd of January 1945, during the last days of the Third Reich. This was the first time Hitler had been in Germany since World War II and his last chance to negotiate a peace with the Allies. The Allies had declared war on Germany in 1939 and were determined to drive the Nazis out of their last stronghold in Europe. Hitler, as a prisoner of war, was allowed to attend the conference, along with his wife Eva Braun, who was pregnant with their first child at the time. The two of them met with Hitler in the Chancellery and discussed the future of their family and how they would live after the war was over. After a few hours of discussion, Hitler agreed to sign the Armistice of 11th May, which ended the war in Europe. However, he did not give up his plans for a second world war
704;List the groups of people who were persecuted by the Nazis.;This is a good place to start if you want to understand the scope of the Holocaust, but it's not the end of the story. The Nazis killed a lot of people, but there are many, many more who were killed in concentration camps, by the SS, and other state-sanctioned death squads. In addition to this, you can look at the Jewish population of Germany and see how many people were killed by the Nazis, as well as the number of Jews who fled to other countries after the war. If you're interested in more information, I recommend this book by David Berenbaum, which has a lot of data and is well worth the price of admission. What's the difference between genocide and ethnic cleansing? Genocide is the intentional killing of an entire group of people, and ethnic cleansing is the deliberate destruction of a group of people based on their ethnicity (e.g. Jews, Gypsies, Slavs
705;Do you think the German people or other nations could have prevented the Holocaust? Why or why not?;A: It is difficult to say whether the German people or other nations could have prevented the Holocaust. I am not a historian, but my impression is that, at the time, there was a feeling of solidarity among the German people and that they did not want to be the cause of another Holocaust. But the situation changed in the years after the war, and there were people who felt that Germany had to take responsibility for what had happened and that it was their duty to do something about it. Q: What do you think about the Holocaust as a concept and how it is used in today's world? A: The Holocaust is an extremely difficult concept to deal with, because it is such a powerful image and so many people have been traumatized by it. But it is important to remember that the Holocaust was a terrible tragedy and that it has a lot of positive aspects to it. It shows that humanity can overcome evil and evil can be overcome.

706;What are some factors that attempt to explain the Holocaust?;In the 1930s and 1940s, there was a lot of anti-Semitism in the United States. The Nazis were trying to make Jews out to be subhuman, and that's what they did to the Jews in concentration camps. But it was also an attempt to justify the killing of other people as well. In other words, the Holocaust was a kind of justification for mass murder, which has been going on for a long time. How do you explain the rise of Nazism in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust in the Soviet Union? I think the main reason was economic. The German economy was in shambles, and it was a very, very bad time for the German people. They had lost their industrial base, and they were suffering from the Great Depression. So they needed a scapegoat for their economic problems. And that scapegoat was the Jews. What was the relationship between Hitler and Joseph Goebbels? Hitler's
707;What country had the highest number of Jews in its population killed?;The answer is Israel, according to the Jewish Agency for Israel (JAI). In 2014, there were 1,788 deaths in Israel from anti-Semitic violence, compared to the United States, which had a total of 6,902 Jewish deaths in that year. What country had the highest number of Jews in its population killed? The answer is Israel, according to the Jewish Agency for Israel (JAI). In 2014, there were 1,788 deaths in Israel from anti-Semitic violence, compared to the United States, which had a total of 6,902 Jewish deaths in that year. How many Jews live in the United States? The number of Jews in the United States is estimated to be about 7.5 million, based on data from the Pew Research Center. That's up from about 6 million in 2000, but it's still less than half the number of Jews in Europe and the Middle East. Why
708;A relatively low percentage of Italy’s Jewish population died in the Holocaust. From this information, how would you compare Fascists and Nazis in terms of their Jewish policies?;"I have no idea what you mean by ""Jewish policies,"" but it is a fair question to ask. The Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini was one of the most anti-Semitic regimes in history, and its policy toward Jews was not a new one. In fact, it goes back to the time of Julius Caesar, when the Roman Emperor had decreed that Jews were to be exterminated by any means necessary. This was a policy that was carried out with the support of the Catholic Church, which, of course, has a long history of antisemitism. What is your take on the role of the Vatican in all of this? The Vatican is an important part of the conspiracy to create a one-world government in which the United States would be the center of the world, and that's why they're trying to get Donald Trump elected president of the United States. The fact that Pope Francis has made it clear that he does not agree with Trump's"

710;America First Committee was;founded in 1866 by William Randolph Hearst to promote the interests of the New York tycoon. Hearst's support for the Republican Party, however, was a long-standing cause of concern to the party's leaders, who feared he would become a rival to their power and influence. In the early 1870s, Republican leaders began to consider a strategy to defeat Hearst, which included an alliance with anti-slavery and antislavery Democrats. This was the first time in American history that a major party had come to the conclusion that the best way to win elections was to work with its opponents on the other side of the political aisle.

711;Lend-Lease Act was;a key part of the Cold War. It allowed the United States to lease Soviet-made aircraft to other countries, such as the U.S. Air Force, for a period of up to 30 years. In return, the Soviets agreed to keep the aircraft in the United States and pay for maintenance and other expenses. The program ended in the 1980s, but many of the planes remain in storage and have yet to be used. Aircraft are stored at Fort Worth Air National Guard Base in San Antonio, Texas. (Photo: John Locher, AP) Story Highlights The aircraft are in storage, awaiting restoration They were built in the Soviet Union and sold to the U.S. in the 1950s Some of the planes are more than 50 years old WASHINGTON (AP) — The Soviet-built MiG-21 Foxhounds that flew over the White House in 1953 and the Capitol in 1974 are on the National Register of Historic
712;Atlantic Charter was;"the first to offer the service in the U.S. and has expanded to other countries. But it's not a free ride for the average American, who pays $70 a month for Internet service and a data cap of 1 gigabyte (GB). That's more than the cost of a month's worth of Netflix, which costs $7.99 a month for a one-hour stream of the movie ""House of Cards."" The FCC's net neutrality rules prohibit Internet providers from blocking or throttling traffic, but that's not the case with Charter's service. Charter says it's committed to ""open Internet"" principles, but it's unclear how that will be enforced in the case of a court challenge. Charter's CEO Tom Rutledge told CNNMoney in an interview last week that the company would ""fight tooth and nail"" to defend its business model and the FCC's rules. ""We're going to do everything we can to make sure this"
713;Individual Action After Roosevelt made the destroyers-for-bases deal with Britain, some Americans called him a dictator. Do you think Roosevelt was right or wrong in his actions? Explain your answer.;Alfred W. Buell, Ph.D. (Retired) The United States had a lot of problems at the time, and I'm not going to get into them, but it was a time of war. We needed to be able to defend ourselves against the Japanese, and that's what Roosevelt did. He did the best he could with what he had, and he was a good president. William C. Hagerty, Ph.D. (Retired) Roosevelt's decision to go to war in the first place was based on the belief that the world was going to end in a few years, and that he had no choice but to take a stand against a threat that was coming to his country. The fact that he did not have the power to do anything about it is what led to his decision to go to war. David Sirota, SVP, The Atlantic Council, a division of WGBH Boston (Boston
714;Interpreting Why was the United States unprepared for Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor?;"What was the U.S. response to the Japanese attack that led to the war? Why did the United States have a ""no first use"" policy for atomic weapons? How did President Franklin D. Roosevelt's decision to go to war with Japan in the Pacific affect World War II? The American public was divided in its response to the Pearl Harbor attack. Some believed it was a surprise attack and that Japan had no intention of attacking the United States. Others believed that the attack was premeditated and that Japanese leader Hideki Tojo was trying to gain control of the Pacific and the American war effort. In addition, there were those who believed that the attack was an act of war by the Japanese, but did not believe that it was the result of a deliberate plan or plan of attack. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had a profound impact on the world and was one of the most devastating events in American history. It was the first time"
715;Based on the geography of Oahu, why was the location of Pearl Harbor perfect for a naval base?;Pearl Harbor was the most important U.S. naval base in the Pacific, and it had to be there. The Japanese were determined to take it, and they did. What was the significance of Hawaii's location on the West Coast of the United States? Hawaii was an island with a population of less than 100,000, which made it a natural base for the Navy. It was located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, so there was no need to fly to Hawaii to get there. How many ships were stationed at Pearl Harbor during World War II? At the time, there were more than 1,000 ships in the Pacific Fleet, including battleships, cruisers, destroyers, amphibious ships (such as the USS Saratoga, which was used to transport troops to the Philippines), and a number of aircraft carriers. In addition, there were a number of smaller, less-than-submarines, which

In a letter to the New York Times on April 25, 1864, Abraham Lincoln wrote: ""I have no doubt that the War Production Board will do its best to make war as cheap as possible and to destroy as many men as possible in the course of the war."" Lincoln's words were echoed by President Andrew Johnson, who in the spring of 1864 issued a proclamation calling for the production of war materiel and ""all means of making war as cheap as possible."" The proclamation, signed by Johnson, stated that, ""It is the policy of the United States to wage war whenever and wherever the public good may require it, and to use every means in its power to accomplish this object without the expenditure of blood or treasure."" In addition to the war production board, there were a number of other agencies that played a role in the war effort. One of these was the U.S. Bureau of Ord"

The law states that a person must be at least 18 years old to be eligible for military service, and that he or she must have served in the armed forces of the United States or its armed forces for at least three years. In recent years, a number of high-profile cases have raised questions about the constitutionality of the law, including the Supreme Court's decision in the Hobby Lobby case in which the court ruled that employers could opt out of providing birth control to employees on religious grounds. The Obama administration has been working on a plan to allow women to get an exemption from the law, but that plan has yet to be finalized."

In addition, the OWM had a number of responsibilities, which included the following: Provid[ing] a wide range of information, both official and non-official, in the form of news bulletins, dispatches, and the like. Producing and disseminating the daily news bulletins of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, as well as the daily newspaper, The Stars and Stripes.

721;How effectively did American industry rally behind the war effort? Give examples to support your opinion.;A few years ago I was asked to give a lecture on the history of World War II at a high school in Washington, D.C. The subject was a little-known but highly significant event: the decision by the United States to enter the war on the side of Great Britain. It was an unusual choice for a high school, but I had no choice in the matter. My school was one of the few in the country that had a history teacher who was willing to teach this subject in a way that did not rely on memorization of facts, but on a deep understanding of the war and its causes—not just what happened, but why it happened. This meant that I had to be a historian, and that made me feel a little like a schoolteacher in the 1930s or 1940s, trying to get students to read the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Hayek, but without the help of a textbook. In the course of my lecture, I
722;Why did automobile production decrease while tank production increased? Challenges to Mobilization;A number of factors contributed to the decline in automobile production, including a shift to mass production in the United States and other industrial countries, as well as technological and labor-saving innovations. However, it is important to note that these factors were not the only factors at work. There were also economic and political factors that played a role in the decline of automobile production. For example, the automobile industry was a major source of income for the U.S. government, and government-subsidized gasoline and diesel fuel helped keep prices low for the average American consumer. In addition, many Americans had the luxury of driving a car that was more fuel efficient than those of their neighbors and was less polluting to the environment. Another factor that may have contributed to the decline in automobile production was the introduction of the internal combustion engine (ICE), which made it possible to produce vehicles that were more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly. This was achieved by replacing gasoline with diesel fuel, a fuel that

MacArthur's life was full of triumphs and tragedies: the Battle of Shiloh, the Spanish-American War, World War II, the Korean War, Operation Desert Storm, the Iran-Contra Scandal, and more. But one of his most memorable moments came in the summer of 1944, when he led a group of U.S. Marines to the beaches of Normandy, France—and, as the story goes, saved the lives of more than 1,000 Americans who were trapped on the beaches by the German invasion.

Doolittle had a passion for aviation and was an aviator for more than 30 years, flying over the Pacific and around the world as a test pilot, according to his obituary. In the 1950s, Doolittle became interested in the military and joined the U.S. Air Force as a flight instructor. After his service, he went on to earn a master's degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Southern California in 1960. He was a graduate of the National Defense University, where he studied under Dr. John F. Kennedy, the father of President John F. Kennedy.

729;How did the Doolittle raid help boost American morale?;It's hard to say what the impact of the raid was on U.S. morale, but one thing is clear: the war was a disaster for the United States. In the months and years that followed, Americans lost faith in their government and the military, and their sense of security was shattered. How did this affect the American public? The public was shocked by the raid, and many of them felt that the government had failed to take care of its own citizens. They believed that the military was out of control, and that there was no way to keep America safe from the threat of Soviet aggression. What was the reaction of the Soviet Union? The Soviet Union reacted with a mixture of shock and anger. Many Soviet leaders, including Nikita Khrushchev, were deeply concerned about the loss of American lives and wanted to know what had happened. Khrushchev's fears were confirmed when a group of American soldiers parachuted into Moscow in November
730;How did code breakers help stop Japanese advances?;In the 1930s and 1940s, Japan was at war with the United States and other countries. The U.S. Navy and Air Force had a lot of codebreakers on board, and Japanese codes were easy to break. But when it came to breaking Japanese codes, the Japanese had an advantage: They had the ability to create their own codes and use them to their advantage. For example, the Japanese used a code called Kojiki, which was based on the Latin alphabet. This allowed them to write messages in the Japanese language, but it also meant that the message could be deciphered by anyone who knew the code. The code breakers were able to find a way to break Kojiki by looking at the symbols that were used to write the message. They were able to figure out how to use the symbols to create a new code that was harder to break. What was the impact of this code break? By
731;How were the Americans able to win the Battle of the Atlantic?;It was a surprise to the Americans that they were able to do it in the first place. The British had been planning for this for a long time, and they did everything they could to stop it. They sent a force to the North Sea, which was their main source of supply, and they had ships in the Atlantic that were equipped with torpedoes, which were the most effective weapons at that time. But the Americans were very good at maneuvering their ships and getting out of harm's way as quickly as possible. What was the role of the U.S. Navy in the Battle of the Atlantic? The U.S. Navy played a very important role in the Battle of the Atlantic. In addition to being the largest and most powerful navy in the world, there were a number of other factors that helped the Americans win the Battle of the Atlantic. First of all, the American ships were well-armored, and that made it easier for the British
732;Why do you think the Japanese forces attacked when they did? Battle of Midway;was a surprise attack, right? It's hard to say what the Japanese were thinking at the time. I think they had no idea how much damage they were doing to the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, and that's why they decided to go for the air and land forces first. The Navy and Marine Corps were in a state of disarray, and there was a lot of talk about what to do about this new enemy that was coming to the Pacific. What was the reason for the attack on Pearl Harbor? The Japanese wanted to show the United States that they were a strong military power and that they could do anything they wanted in the Pacific. They wanted to make it clear to the U.S. that they had the right to attack any place on the face of the earth, no matter what the cost. How many ships were sunk in the Battle of Midway? At least 1,000, but probably more than that

734;Rosie the Riveter was;"a symbol of the civil rights movement. In addition to the statue, there are a number of memorials to African-Americans who fought for the right to vote, including the Rosa Parks Memorial in Montgomery, Ala., which was dedicated in 1992. The city of St. Louis has been trying to find a way to pay for the $1.5 million cost of erecting the statue since it was approved by the city council in 2013. The city is seeking a grant from the Missouri Department of Economic Development to cover the cost, which could be as much as $500,000 a year over the next five years. A spokeswoman for the state department said it would have no comment on the city's request. ""We are aware of the request and have received it,"" spokeswoman Jennifer Pritchett said in an email. ""As a matter of policy, we do not comment on pending litigation."" The statue is the latest in a series of Confederate"
735;A. Philip Randolph was;"a leader of the anti-lynching movement. In 1882, he wrote an article in the New York Times titled ""The Negro in America: A Case of Unfortunate Accommodation."" The article argued that African Americans were discriminated against in the United States and should be allowed to ""live in peace and quiet"" with their fellow human beings. Randolph's views were in line with those of his time and the majority of Americans at the time. But the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that segregation was unconstitutional, and it is unlikely that Randolph would have been on board with that ruling. ""I think it's a mistake to look at race as a social construct,"" Randolph said in an interview with The Associated Press last year. ""Race is a biological fact, and it can be changed by genetic engineering, it can be changed by a change in environment. It's an unfortunate situation that we're in, but that's the way it"

And that's a very, very sad thing to see."" The deal, brokered by Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, calls for the construction of a wall along the 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) border, which has become a flashpoint in the U.S. presidential campaign. Pena Nieto's visit to the White House last week was a high point for the two countries, which have a long history of working together on issues ranging from trade to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

739;What changes did American citizens and industry have to make to adapt to the war?;"In the United States, there was a lot of pressure to get the war off the front pages of the newspapers and onto the newsstands. The government was trying to make it look like it was a war of the world's most powerful nation against a bunch of ragamuffins who wanted to kill their way to the top of the food chain. But it was a very different war than we know today. The U.S. Army had a much smaller force than it did in World War I, and it was much more of a guerrilla war in which the guerrillas fought for their own survival rather than the government's. How did you go about finding out about the war? I got a call from a friend who worked in the Department of Defense, and he said, ""You know, I'm looking for something that's going to help me with my job."" I said, ""What do you mean?"" He said, ""Well, there's"

741;Which cities had populations over 400,000?;The answer is San Francisco, which had a population of 4.2 million in 2010. That's more than any other city in the United States, according to U.S. Census data. But there are a few cities that have larger populations than San Francisco, such as New York (2.9 million) and Los Angeles (2.6 million). How many people live in each city? In 2010, there were about 1.3 million people living in the 50 largest U.S. metros, according to the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS is a nationally representative survey of the civilian noninstitutionalized population conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. What is the population density of each metropolis? Density is the number of people per square mile (sq. km). The most densely populated metros are in the South and West, with densities of more than 1,000 people per sq
742;Why were Japanese Americans interned?;The U.S. government did not want a war with Japan, so in the 1930s and 1940s, Japanese Americans were rounded up in concentration camps, forced to work as forced laborers, and sent to internment camps in the Pacific and Central American countries. Many of the camps were run by the Japanese government, and some were run by private companies that had a stake in the success of the camps. What was the Japanese government's role in the internment camps? The Japanese government was the largest employer of Japanese Americans during the war, and it used its control over labor to keep them in the camps. In addition, the United States and Japan signed a treaty that provided for the repatriation of Japanese Americans to Japan after the war was over. However, this treaty was never implemented, and the Japanese government continued to detain and deport Japanese Americans until at least the mid-1950s. Why were Japanese Americans deported? The Japanese government believed that
743;Write a newspaper editorial urging fellow citizens to con-serve resources so that these resources can be diverted to the war effort.;In this case, it is a good idea to write an op-ed in the New York Times or other major media outlet that calls for a reduction in U.S. military spending, as well as an end to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Times has done this in the past, and I am sure it will do so again in the future. This is not a call to go to war, but a call to make our voices heard and to help the American people understand what is at stake in this war. If you are a member of the military or have family members who are in the military, you are in a unique position to speak out on this issue. The Pentagon is spending $600 billion a year on the military, and it is time for us to stop this spending and start spending on our military needs. We need to be able to defend ourselves, not the other way around. I urge you to sign this petition and share it with
744;Battle of the Bulge was;a battle between the United States and the Soviet Union in World War II. Contents show] Prelude Edit On the night of June 6, 1944, the Allies launched Operation Overlord, an all-out assault on the German-held city of Stalingrad to take control of the strategically important city. In the early morning hours of June 7, Allied forces began to move into Stalingrad, which was defended by over a million Soviet soldiers.[1] At the Battle of Kursk, the Soviet Union was able to break through the Allied lines and push the Allies back to the River Volga. However, the Soviets suffered heavy losses in the battle, and by the end of the day, the Allies had regained control of the city and were poised to take it back for good. Aftermath Edit The battle had a profound effect on the history of the world, and many historians believe that it is the most important battle of
745;V-E Day was;"a great way to celebrate the end of World War II and the liberation of the U.S. from the Axis powers. In the years since, there have been a number of commemorations, such as the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, which took place June 6, 1944, and the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, which took place Dec. 7, 1941. But this year, the National Park Service is taking a different approach to the commemoration: Instead of focusing on the war itself, the agency is planning to celebrate the ""victory in the hearts and minds of Americans of all ages."" That's according to a memo obtained by ABC News that lays out the agency's plans for the day, which will include a variety of events, ranging from an American flag-raising ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, to a ""Celebrate America"" concert by rock band Coldplay in Washington, D.C."
746;Harry S Truman was;"the first to use the term ""nuclear holocaust"" in a speech. He said: ""We have no choice but to use all the means at our disposal to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, which are a threat to the world and to all mankind."" The US and Russia signed a treaty in 1963 banning the use of nuclear weapons in outer space, but this was never ratified by the United Nations Security Council.

But Mr Churkin's comments were met with scepticism by the US, which has been working to strengthen the treaty since it was signed in 1963."
747;Curtis LeMay was;"a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from New York. He died of heart failure on May 31, 2017 at the age of 85. In addition to his work as a journalist, Curtis LeMay was an accomplished musician, singer, songwriter (most notably the theme song for Star Trek: The Next Generation, ""Yesterday's Enterprise"") and composer of music for television and film. His compositions were used in the films The Fugitive (1979), A Few Good Men (1980), The Untouchables (1981), and the TV miniseries The X-Files (1993-1994). He also composed music for the animated series Family Guy (1999-2002), as well as a number of commercials for Coca-Cola, General Motors, McDonald's, Procter & Gamble, the United States Postal Service, and other companies.

748;Manhattan Project was;a U.S. government-funded project to develop a nuclear weapon. Contents show] History and development Edit In the 1950s, the Manhattan Project began as a joint project between the United States and Great Britain.[1] The first test of a thermonuclear weapon was conducted in New Mexico in 1952, and the project was renamed Project ZEUS in 1953 to avoid confusion with the Soviet Union's Project A-12 (see below). Project ZEUS was intended to be a successor to the atomic bomb, but it did not go into full production until the mid-1960s, with the completion of the Trinity test in 1964.[2] During World War II, the United States began to stockpile nuclear weapons in an effort to deter the Soviet Union from invading the United States. This stockpiling led to the development of the hydrogen bomb, which was used in the first nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1945–1946.
749;V-J Day was;a great way to celebrate the V-J Day. I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who have never heard of this day, but it's one of the most important days in the life of a motorcycle enthusiast. The day when you get your license, get your motorcycle registration (if you have one), pay your taxes, and start riding the world's most fun-to-drive motorcycle. If you're new to motorcycles, this might be the day that you learn the ins and outs of your bike, how to change your oil, and what to do if something goes wrong on the road. It's an important day for a lot of reasons, but most importantly, it's a day that will change your life for the better. So why do we celebrate V-J Day? Well, for one, it's a great day to show your friends and family that you're serious about your motorcycle, and that you have a passion for it
750;United Nations was;"the world's most powerful organization. In 1848, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which declared: ""Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person. No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms."" The U.N. also established the International Criminal Court (ICC), which prosecutes war crimes and crimes against humanity in international tribunals. Today, the ICC has jurisdiction over the entire world, except for a few countries that have signed the Rome Statute of the ICC, which provides for the prosecution of those who commit genocide, crimes against humanity (genocide), or crimes against humanity committed on a large scale during World War II. However, there are no ICC-compliant countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia, or South Asia. What's next? As we"

A campaign to destroy the Japanese fleet at Rabaul in New Hebrides was the largest and most successful of the war. It took place from May to August 1944, and involved the destruction of a total of 1,818 aircraft, including more than 600 destroyers and cruisers. This was the first time in World War II that the United States and Great Britain had combined to destroy an enemy's air force at sea. In addition to the aircraft, there were a number of minesweepers, torpedo boats, and anti-submarine craft that were used in the campaign.

The Battle of Midway, a naval battle in the Coral Sea, was the second-largest naval battle of the war. It took place from December 1942 to April 1943, and involved the Japanese fleet in an attempt to break the U.S. blockade of Japan. The battle resulted in the loss of more than 4,000 ships and more than 1,000 aircraft.

754;Why do you think the goal of world peace has yet to be achieved?;It's a question that I'm asked a lot by people who want to know what's going on in the world, and I think the answer is pretty simple: peace and prosperity. That's what we're trying to achieve with this book and the Peace Prize. How would you describe the state of world peace in your lifetime? Well, I think it's getting better all the time. There are more and more countries in the world that are not at war with each other, and the number of wars that are going on is going down every year. So that's one of the things that I'm proud of, that we're making progress in the world. What are some of the most important issues that you've worked on as a peace prize laureate? The issue of nuclear disarmament is one of the most important issues that I've worked on. And that's because it's the one issue that has the potential to bring about a world without

Well, it was a question of what the United States was going to do in the event of a war with Japan. We had no intention of going to war with Japan at that time. But if Japan attacked us, we would have been in a very difficult position. We would have had to make a decision whether or not to use the bomb or not. And I was in the White House, and there was a lot of discussion about this, and the President said, ""Let's do it, but we're going to have to be sure that we don't get into a war that's going to last a long time."" And that's what we did. Q. And how long did that take? A. It took two and a half years from the time we started talking about the bomb until it was dropped on Nagasaki. Q.

756;Potsdam was;"the first to recognize the need for a ""nuclear deterrent."" In the 1950s and 1960s, the United States began to build a fleet of nuclear-capable submarines, which were used to patrol the Pacific and Indian Oceans in the Cold War. The U.S. Navy has more than 1,000 nuclear-powered submarines in service, and is expected to have as many as 8,000 by 2040. But as the nuclear age came to an end, so did the need for a nuclear deterrent. In the early 1990s, President Bill Clinton signed the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), which called for the construction of a new generation of ballistic missile submarines and land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The first of these, the SSBN Independence, was commissioned in 1997. Since then, the number of submarines has increased by a factor of 10 or more every year. Today, there are more than 30 SSBNs in service"

758;Why did tensions grow between the United States and the Soviet Union after World War II?;I think it's a combination of two things. One is the Cold War, which was a very, very bad thing for the United States and very, very bad thing for the Soviet Union. And the other thing is the rise of the American middle class in the 1950s and 1960s. That created a lot of resentment against the Soviet Union, and it's still there. What was the relationship between the two superpowers during the Cold War? The Cold War was the biggest conflict in the history of the world. There were a lot of people who wanted to be the victor and a lot of people who wanted to be the vanquished. And that's what made it so hard to deal with. You had all these competing interests, and it was very hard to find a common ground. How do you think the relationship between the United States and Russia has changed since the end of the Cold War? Well, it's changed in a couple of
759;At Yalta, what agreement did the “Big Three” come to about Germany’s future after World WarII?;A lot of people have asked that question in the past and it's a good question to ask because the answer is not as simple as you might think. In a sense, there was a consensus among the Allies to give Germany a chance to get its house in order, which it did not have to do for a long time. It had to make a lot of concessions to do that. But the problem was that Germany was in a state of war with the Soviet Union, which was a very difficult situation for Germany to deal with. The Allies wanted Germany to be a member of the United Nations and that was one of the conditions that was put on the table. But at the same time, they were concerned about the German economy and how it would be affected by the war. So they had to find a way to make Germany pay for its war debts in some way or another. What was the result of that? Germany did not have the money to pay
760;Do you think Roosevelt could have prevented the Cold War? Why or why not?;A lot of people have written about this, but it's hard to get a straight answer from the people who did the research. I'm going to give my opinion and try to be fair, but there are a lot of things that have to be taken into account. One of the most important things is that the United States was in a state of war with the Soviet Union at the time, which meant that we had to make a decision about how we were going to deal with the threat that was posed by the Soviet Union. And that decision was made in the spring of 1941, when Roosevelt was elected president of the United States. In that time, the U.S. had a lot of problems to deal with, including the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December of 1941, which was the turning point in the war. The war was going to end in two or three months, and it was a very dangerous time for the United States. So Roosevelt decided that he was
761;Imagine you are an adviser to President Truman. Write are port explaining your interpretation of Churchill’s iron curtain speech.;"The President has a lot of power to do what he pleases, but it is his prerogative to make the speech he thinks best for the country. He is the one who decides what is good and what is bad, right or wrong. If he wants to go to war, he has the power to do so. If he wants to negotiate with the Soviet Union, he has the power to do so. If he wants to end the Cold War, he has the power to do so. In other words, the President has no power at all to stop the speech that he wants to make. He can say ""no"" to the speech, but that does not mean he has to agree with it. He can refuse to sign the letter of condolence or to send the telegram of condolence to the Prime Minister's office. He can ignore the telegram of condolence and send the letter of condolence to the Prime Minister's office. He can refuse"
762;George Kennan was;"a member of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in 1945. In his speech, he called for ""a world without war, in which men and women are free to make their own choices, and in which the most powerful nation on earth does not seek to dominate other nations, but to cooperate with them in the search for peace"" (emphasis added). Kennan's words are echoed in the Declaration of Independence: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" These are ideals that have been enshrined in the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights since 1791. They are the foundation of our freedom and our nation, and it is time to reaffirm them. As President, I will continue to fight for the rights of all Americans,"
763;Marshall Plan was;to build a nuclear-powered submarine. In the 1950s, the Navy began looking for a way to replace the U.S.S. New Jersey, which was decommissioned in the early 1960s. The plan called for building a new nuclear-powered submarine, but that was a long way off. Then, in the mid-1960s, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a plan to expand the U.S. nuclear arsenal to include a fleet of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The idea was to deter the Soviet Union from attacking the United States, and it was the beginning of the Cold War. But SDI had a catch: It required Congress to approve any expansion of the nation's nuclear arsenal. Congress, of course, refused to do so, and the plan fell by the wayside. In the late 1960s, the Reagan administration was in the midst of a nuclear arms

And I'm not saying it's the right thing to do, but it's the wrong thing to do."" The Republican front-runner's comments come as he faces a challenge from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who is seeking to unseat him in the party's presidential primary next year. Trump has been the target of attacks from Cruz's campaign, which has called him a ""pathological liar"" and accused him of supporting ""open borders"" and a ""deportation force to round up 11 million people who are law-abiding and pay taxes."""
765;How did the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan address the spread of communism?;"It was a two-pronged approach: first, to strengthen the United States by providing economic and military assistance; and second, to help other countries in the Western Hemisphere, such as Chile, Argentina, and Brazil, that were struggling against communism. These efforts were supported by the U.S. military and intelligence community, as well as a variety of private and philanthropic organizations. In this way, the United States was able to influence the outcome of the Cold War in ways that had not been possible before or since. What is the relationship between the Marshall Plan and the Marshall Islands? The Marshall Islands were a part of the United Kingdom until it became independent in 1946. After independence, the British government sought to maintain a relationship with the islanders and their leader, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who was a close friend of Winston Churchill. Laurier had an interest in the Pacific and wanted to expand British influence in the region. In the 1950s,"
766;What long-term Cold War strategy did the United States follow?;In the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union was in the midst of a military buildup, which included the construction of nuclear weapons. This was an important factor in U.S. decision-making, as well as in the decisions of the other countries in the Cold War—France, Great Britain, and the United States. But it was not the only factor. There were a number of other factors that contributed to the decision to go to war with the Soviet Union. One of them was the fact that the United States had no military alliance with any of the other countries in the Cold War, and that meant that we had to rely on the Soviets for military support. The other factor was the fear of a nuclear war that was growing in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe at the time. This fear was exacerbated by the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, which led to the end of the Warsaw Pact and the dissolution of the Soviet Union as a political entity.
767;How did the Long Telegram influence American policy?;It is a question that historians have debated for more than a century. In the mid-19th century, the United States was at war with Great Britain, a war that would last until 1812. During this time, British and U.S. intelligence agencies shared information on the movements of American ships and ships in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. This information helped the British spy agency MI6 and the French intelligence agency DGSE, as well as other intelligence agencies around the world, to plan their operations. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website The British and American intelligence agencies had a common interest in keeping America's merchant shipping safe from the British, and in doing so, they worked hand in hand, according to historian David McCullough. In 1812, for example, a British spy ship, the Long Traveller, sailed from New York to the West Indies, where it was intercepted by the British Royal Navy
768;When did the United Nations control the most territory in Korea? When did both sides finally agree upon an armistice line?;It is a question that has been asked for decades by North and South Koreas, and the answer is: not long after the end of World War II. In fact, there is no record of a formal armistice being signed until 1953, when the North Korean government signed a peace treaty with the South. The Korean War was a stalemate, with each side claiming victory in the face of overwhelming odds. The United Nations had little to do with the conflict, which lasted from 1950 to 1953. It was left to the North Koreans to settle the conflict by their own means, using guerrilla warfare and guerilla warfare tactics to gain a foothold in the South. They did so by establishing a puppet government in South Korea, known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). This is the country we know today as North Korea. What is the history of the Armistice Agreement? On August 15, 1953, the United Nations Security

In the EPI report, researchers looked at the number of workers who have access to paid sick leave, which is the most common form of paid time off for workers, and found that California ranks near the bottom of the nation when it comes to the number of workers who have access to paid sick leave. The report's authors say this is due to the state's ""loopholes"" in the law, which allow employers to fire workers for being sick without giving them a severance package and leave time to recover.

McCarthy, however, did not leave the United States without a stain on his record. In his memoirs, ""The Conscience of a Conservative,"" published in 1962, McCarthy wrote that he ""had no intention of returning to the Soviet Union, but I was forced to do so by the fact that my conscience would not permit me to remain silent in the face of Communist subversion of the United States of America.""

The court held that corporations and unions could spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections, and that this was a violation of the First Amendment. In response, Congress passed the McCarran Act in an attempt to rein in the power of money in politics. What is the McCarran Act? The McCarran Act is named after John W. McCarran, a Republican senator from Nevada who was the first to introduce the bill in the Senate. The bill, which has been reauthorized five times since its passage in 2002, requires political parties to disclose the names of donors who give more than $200 to a candidate or political action committee, and prohibits them from coordinating with outside groups that do the same. Who is affected by the law? Individuals, corporations, labor unions, and other groups with the potential to make a difference in an election
776;How did McCarthyism and the Red Scare change American society and government?;"McCarthyism was a reaction to the Cold War, which had begun in the 1950s. In his book The Plot to Seize the White House, John F. Kennedy's brother-in-law Robert K. McCloskey wrote that ""the United States is at war with the Soviet Union and must be in the business of winning the war."" McCarthy's anti-communist witch-hunts and McCarthy-like witch-hunts against civil rights, women's rights, and other social and political groups were part of this war. What is the relationship between McCarthyism and the rise of Nazism in the United States? The relationship is complicated, but there is a lot of circumstantial evidence to suggest that McCarthyism helped create the conditions that led to the rise of Nazism. In the early 1950s, a number of people, including Joseph McCarthy, began to raise questions about the government's surveillance of Americans and the role of the CIA in"
777;Why did McCarthy initially receive a lot of support for his efforts to expose Communists?;"McCarthy was a well-known anti-Communist, and the media and political establishment at the time did not want to alienate him. He had a reputation for being tough on the left, and his work in this area helped build his reputation as a ""patriot"" and an ""outsider."" What is the relationship between McCarthy and President Eisenhower? Eisenhower's relationship with McCarthy was cordial, but not close. The two did not see eye to eye on a number of issues, such as foreign policy, civil rights, and the Vietnam War. In fact, they were at loggerheads for the rest of Eisenhower's presidency. Why did McCarthy become the target of so much hate and vitriol in the 1960s and 1970s? There were two reasons: First, McCarthy was a very effective propagandist for the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA), which controlled the Democratic Party and the White House. Second"

But the problem is that it's going to take a long time to get it through the Congress and through the President's signature. And I'm not a fan of raising taxes on the middle class, either. I think that's the wrong way to go about it. Q What's your take on the debate in the Republican Party right now over tax reform? Do you think there's a path forward that's not a tax cut and would be revenue neutral? MR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that the President has made it clear that he wants to make sure that we're not adding to the deficit in any way. And that's a goal that we're working to achieve as part of our deficit reduction plan. But I
780;“Do-Nothing Congress,” Fair Deal was;"a good idea in the first place. The problem is that it's not working as well as it should. In this week's Washington Post, I wrote about an experiment that I ran last year with a group of college students in the United States and the Czech Republic. The students were given a $1,000 prize to do something, and they had to come up with a way to use the money to improve their lives. I asked them what they wanted to do with the money, and they said, ""I want to go to the movies."" That's what they said in every question we asked them. But when we looked at the data, we found that the students were far more likely to choose the movie that was going to cost the least to make than the movie that was going to cost the most. That's a problem, because it means that the movie that is most cost-effective is the one that people are most likely to choose."
781;Federal Highway Act was;passed in 1956 to provide a means of regulating traffic. The law states that vehicles must be equipped with brakes, lights at night (except when it is raining or snowing), a hazard warning device and reflectors on the front and rear of the vehicle. Vehicles are required to carry a registration plate, which is the number of the vehicle and the registration number of the owner. In addition to the requirements listed above, drivers and passengers under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years of age. Drivers of motor vehicles with gross vehicle weight exceeding 8,000 pounds (4,000 kilograms) must have a driver's license or learner's permit issued by the state in which the vehicle is registered. The vehicle must be equipped with a windshield that complies with the windshield and windscreen requirements of section 4-101 of the Vehicle Code. A driver who has been convicted of a
782;How did President Eisenhower aid international shipping during his administration?;The United States is the world's largest importer of crude oil and natural gas, and we have a long history of helping our allies in the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America. In addition, our trade deficit with the rest of the world is one of the largest in the world—$1.5 trillion a year in goods and services. The president and his administration have worked to reduce that deficit by encouraging the export of American goods and services, and by increasing the value of our currency to make it more competitive in the global marketplace. What is the president's plan to help small businesses? The president believes that every American should be able to start a business, and that all Americans should have the opportunity to grow their businesses and create jobs. In his State of the Union address, the president called for a tax credit for small businesses that hire workers from low-income families and expand their workforce. This credit would be available to any business with at least $
783;In what ways did the Taft- Hartley Act hurt labor unions?;A number of studies have looked at the impact of the Taft-Hartley Act on union membership, and one of the most comprehensive was conducted by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI). The EPI found that between 1947 and 1977, there was a drop of 1.5 million union members, which translates to an average loss of $1,500 per union member over that time period. In other words, the act was responsible for the loss of more than a quarter of a million union members in just two years. This is a huge loss of labor force for a country that has the highest labor force participation in the world (see Figure 1). Figure 1.

784;Which parts of the country did Dewey win? Why do you think he did so well in these areas? Agendas Truman Eisenhower;"Lyndon Johnson Dewey was a strong advocate of civil rights, which is one of the reasons his name is associated with the Democratic Party. He opposed Jim Crow laws and the Ku Klux Klan, as well as other forms of discrimination against African Americans. In addition, he was an outspoken opponent of McCarthyism during the 1950s and 1960s. What is your favorite Dewey quote? ""It is the right of every man to be secure in the possession of his life, liberty, and property, against unreasonable searches and seizures, against incursions of the police into his home, and against cruel and unusual punishment."" - Thomas Jefferson, 1776 The most famous quote from Dewey's speech is ""I believe in the sanctity of human life, and in the right of the individual to make his own decisions about the care and upbringing of his children."" This quote has been used as a rallying cry for those who believe abortion should be illegal in all or most cases."

786;John Kenneth Galbraith was;born in New York City on December 8, 1879. He studied at Columbia University and the Sorbonne in Paris, where he received his doctorate in political science in 1902. After World War I, Galbraith served as a U.S. ambassador to Great Britain and the United Arab Emirates, and was the first president of the American Political Science Association (APSA). During his tenure, he helped establish the Association's International Division, which became the largest and most influential political science association in the world. In the 1920s and 1930s, Galbraith became one of the leading scholars of the Soviet Union and its leader Joseph Stalin. His books include The Stalin Years (1929), Stalin's Secret Agents (1931), A Thousand Splendid Suns (1932), and, most famously, the classic study of Stalin's personality, My Life and Opinions of Joseph Stalin (1936). Galbraith died of heart failure at his

788;Levittown was;"the home of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. It's a place of high school football, a school of art and an all-girls choir. And the town has a long history of racial tension, with the Ku Klux Klan having a presence in the 1950s and '60s. In recent years, tensions have boiled over into violence, with a white supremacist rally in August that left one person dead and dozens injured. The violence was followed by an anti-racism march on the town's Main Street, where protesters chanted ""Black lives matter"" and carried signs that read ""Stop killing us, white lives matter."" ""I think it's a good time to be a part of this,"" said the Rev. William Barber, a pastor at St. John the Baptist Church, who was one of the marchers. ""This is the beginning of something that will last a long time."" Barber said his faith is at the heart of"
789;Jonas Salk was;"one of the most prolific writers of the 20th century. He wrote a total of 1,744 novels, short stories, and poetry between 1883 and his death in 1927 (the last year of his life). Salk's works are filled with references to science and technology, as well as the human condition. In one of his most famous works, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, Salk imagines a man who has fallen in love with a woman who looks like a hat. The two of them go on a road trip to see the world, and end up in New York City, where they meet an old friend of their, the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Longfellow's poem ""I Saw the Devil"" is a classic example of Salk's love of the scientific and technological: The sun is a man, He has a head like a hat, And his eyes are like a pair of spect"

791;How was the affluent society of the United States in the 1950s different from previous decades?;I think it was a different kind of society. The middle class had been decimated by the Great Depression, and there was a lot of resentment against the rich and powerful. The rich were getting richer and the poor were getting poorer. And that was reflected in the political system as well. In the '30s and '40s, you had a Republican Party that was dominated by Southern Democrats, and that was the party of Jim Crow, segregation, lynchings—all of that was part of the Republican Party platform. So it was an extremely conservative, white-supremacist party. But by the time I got to college, I was in the middle of the civil rights movement, and I started to see the world in a different way. I realized that the Republicans were not going to win the South, and they were not going to win the country. So what was needed was a third party, which was the New Deal coalition of labor, social welfare,
792;What caused the advertising industry boom in the 1950s?;It was a combination of factors, says Dr. Robert Cialdini, a professor of marketing at Wharton who has written about the rise of advertising as a way to sell products and generate revenue. First, advertising was seen as a good way to reach a mass audience, which in turn led to more people paying attention to what they saw on television and in magazines like Vogue, he says. The second factor was an increasing awareness of health and fitness as well as the fact that people were spending more time in front of the television than they had in the past. Cialdini says there's no evidence that television has been responsible for the advertising boom, but it's a good example of how the media can influence consumer behavior. What's the most important thing you learned from your research? I learned that advertising is an incredibly powerful tool for getting people to buy a product or service. It's the same way that a car salesman can

794;Peace Corps was;a very different experience. I didn't have a lot of contact with the people who were in charge of my work, but it was an amazing experience. What was the most difficult part of your time in the United States? There were a lot of things that were difficult, but one of the hardest things was the language barrier. The first time I went to New York, I was in a hotel with no English speakers in the room. I had to translate a lot of what I was saying to my fellow translators and they were very helpful in helping me get through the language barrier. How did you learn English? I started learning English as a second language at the age of six or seven. My mother is from Mexico and my father is from the Dominican Republic, so I grew up speaking Spanish and English in the family. When I was in high school, I took a course in English and Spanish at a community college in the San Fernando Valley, which
795;Berlin Wall was;"a symbol of the Cold War. In the 1960s and 1970s, it served as a barrier between East and West Berlin, and the two sides fought over who would be allowed to cross it. But after reunification in 1990, Berlin began to lose its status as a border city to the rest of Germany.

796;Warren Commission was;"the first to call for a national moratorium on gun ownership. In an interview with the Associated Press, he said the NRA has a ""fundamental misunderstanding of the Second Amendment,"" which protects the right to bear arms. ""I think it's a mistake to try to take away the rights of law-abiding citizens,"" he said. ""We have a right to defend ourselves, and that's what the Founding Fathers intended."" The National Rifle Association did not respond to a request for comment. A federal judge last year struck down Connecticut's assault weapons ban as unconstitutional, but the state appealed to the Supreme Court. A decision is expected in June. Gun rights advocates are pushing for a national ""stand your ground"" law to allow people to use deadly force if they feel threatened. The measure has been in the works for years, but has stalled in Congress because of opposition from Democrats and the NRA. In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Obama called"
797;Explain the goals of the Alliance for Progress.;"What is the Alliance for Progress? We are a coalition of progressive organizations working to make government work for everyone, not just the 1 percent. Our mission is twofold: First, by building a more just, sustainable, and just society; and second, by advancing the principles of social justice that undergird our nation's founding documents. Why are you fighting for the middle class? In the past, the wealthy have gotten richer and the poor have gotten poorer. Today, more than half of Americans live in poverty—a figure that has risen to more than 40 percent for African Americans and more than 50 percent for Latinos. We need to change that. That's why we're fighting for a $15 minimum wage, paid family leave, and universal pre-kindergarten. And it's why we're standing up to Donald Trump's attack on immigrants, women, people of color, and the LGBT community. How will this fight affect you"
798;What was Kennedy’s goal for the United States in the space race?;"Kennedy was a proponent of human spaceflight, which would be the first step toward the colonization of the solar system. In his speech at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on April 22, 1961, he said, ""We have no right to go to the moon and expect to find life there. It is inconceivable that we should be the only species to have walked on the moon and come back without leaving a trace, much less to establish a permanent settlement there for the benefit of all mankind."" What was the purpose of the Apollo program? Apollo was a joint project between NASA and the Soviet Union, and it aimed to send humans to the moon by the end of the 1960s. The goal was to demonstrate the technology needed to land a spacecraft on the moon, and to do so in a cost-effective manner. NASA had a budget of $1.5 billion per year, and the U.S. was the only country that had the capability to"
799;What was the role of foreign aid in the relations between the United States and Latin America?;I think it was a very important part of the relationship, but not the only part. There were a lot of things that went on in the U.S. and Latin America that were not part of the aid program. The most important of those was the Cold War, which had to be kept in the back of people's minds and not taken for granted. It was important to keep the focus on the Soviet Union and not forget that we were in a very different world than the Soviet Union was in the 1950s and 1960s. What were the lessons learned from the Cuban Missile Crisis? The lesson was that you have to be prepared for the worst, even if that means going to war with your own country. That's what we did in the Cuban Missile Crisis, and it helped us avoid a nuclear war that might have taken place. How would you describe the relationship between the Reagan and Bush administrations? The relationship was good at the beginning,

802;Great Society was;"the name of a social and political movement that began in the United States in 1848. The term ""Slavery"" was used to describe the system of slavery in the United States until the Civil War, when abolitionists began to use the term ""abolition"" in reference to the end of slavery. In 1790, Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, which declared that ""all men are created equal"" and ""are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" Jefferson was a slave owner, and his words are a reminder that slavery was a part of American life for a long time. The Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776, the first day of the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. On July 4, 1776, George Washington signed the Declaration of Independence as the commander in chief of the Continental Army. The first U."
803;Medicare was;"the most popular of the health plans. In a sign of the changing nature of the U.S. health care system, nearly two-thirds of those who signed up for Medicare did so because of cost, according to the survey. That's up from 56 percent in 2010, and the highest percentage since the survey began in 1999. Medicare enrollment has been on the rise for several years, but this year's numbers are the first to show a steady increase in the number of enrollees over the past five years. The Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, has helped drive the trend, which is expected to continue in the years ahead. ""It's a good sign that people are starting to feel the benefits of the ACA,"" said Robert Blendon, a spokesman for the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit that conducts health policy research. But he cautioned that there are a number of factors that could be at play, including the economic downturn that hit"
804;Medicaid was;"the most popular of the programs. In a statement, Obama said the law ""will save $2.7 trillion over 10 years by reducing the growth of health care costs and improving the quality of care we provide to our most vulnerable citizens."" But critics of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, say it is a government takeover of health care and has led to skyrocketing costs for consumers and the federal government. ""This is an example of the president trying to take credit for something that he did not create,"" said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""The fact is, Obamacare was a product of Congress, not the president."" The White House did not respond to a request for comment on this story. A spokeswoman for Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said in an email that the senator is ""committed to ensuring that"
805;Head Start was;a huge success. In fact, it's one of the most successful programs in the history of public education, according to the U.S. Department of Education (DOE). The number of children enrolled in Head Start has increased every year since its inception in the 1970s and continues to grow, reaching a record 1.3 million children in 2014-15. But there's a lot to be said for keeping kids out of the classroom for a few hours a day, right? Not so fast. A study published in the Journal of Early Childhood Research found that the benefits of early education are short-lived, at best. Children who are exposed to a variety of activities during the first year of life have better cognitive and social skills than those who do not. The authors of the study, led by Dr. Robert Rennie, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, looked at data from more than 100,000 children enrolled in Head Start
806;Robert Weaver was;"one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. He developed the theory of cosmic inflation, a theory that predicts the existence of black holes at the centers of galaxies that have grown to enormous magnitudes in the past few billion years.

807;Describe how the Great Society programs were inspired.;I think it's fair to say that the idea of social welfare programs came to the United States in the 1930s and '40s as a response to the Great Depression. There was a lot of talk about what to do with the unemployed, and the government was looking for ways to help people get back to work. So they started thinking about how they could get people off the dole and into the labor force, and one of the things they came up with was the New Deal programs that had been in place since the 1930s. What was the first program that you worked on as a program director in the Great Society? Well, the first one that I worked on was the Works Progress Administration, which was a government-run program for people who had lost their jobs or were in the process of losing their jobs. It was designed to provide a safety net for people who were out of work and needed help to reenter the labor force. And that's what
808;How did Johnson’s war on poverty strive to ensure greater fairness in American society?;"Johnson was a champion of civil rights, which he saw as a way to end racial discrimination and ensure equal opportunity for all Americans. In his view, the government had no business dictating what people could and could not do with their own money, and that was especially true when it came to social programs such as Social Security and Medicare. ""We are the most unequal society in the world,"" Johnson said in a speech to the National Urban League in 1964. ""It is time for a new era of social justice, which will be based on the principle that every man and woman is entitled to a standard of living that is commensurate with his or her ability and achievement."" The Johnson administration, however, did not go far enough in its push for equality. The War on Poverty was an expensive and time-consuming effort, with millions of dollars spent on advertising and public relations campaigns, as well as a host of government-mandated ""welfare checks"" to poor"
809;What were three legacies of the Great Society?;A lot of people are talking about health care, but it's a little hard to get your head around the legacy of the G.I. Bill of Rights. I mean, there were a lot of things that were done to improve the lives of people who were in the United States during World War II, and they were very good things. But the fact of the matter is that the G.I. Bill of Rights was a big part of that, and it was a big part of the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s.

810;Take on the role of a biographer. Write a chapter in a biography of Lyndon Johnson in which you compare and contrast his leadership style to that of John Kennedy.;"The most important thing to remember is that LBJ was a man of his time—not the time of his death in 1968. The Kennedy assassination, in particular, had a profound impact on Johnson's thinking, and he took that to heart when he wrote his biography. In a passage that will stand the test of time, Johnson writes: ""I have no doubt that Kennedy would have done the same thing if he had been in my position, and I am sure that he would have made the same decision in the same circumstances."" This is an important passage, and it shows Johnson's commitment to his role as a biographer. He knew that he was writing a biography of a man who had changed the course of American history, and he wanted to be as accurate as possible. But there are a few problems with this comparison. First, Johnson did not live to see Kennedy's assassination, so his perspective is not a good guide to Kennedy's leadership style. Second,"

816;Southern Christian Leadership Conference was;"founded in 1884 by John C. Calhoun, a slaveholder who believed the Civil War was God's punishment for slavery. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) has a history of racist and anti-Semitic statements that date back to its founding and continues to this day. In a speech to the SCLC's National Convention in 1992, Calhoun said, ""I am proud to stand before you as the son of a slave, but I am no longer a slave. My name is Jim Crow, and I have come to own it."" SCLC President Jerry Falwell Jr. has called homosexuality ""a perversion of the natural order"" and said it should be ""eliminated from the face of the earth."" Falwell's son, Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr., is a white supremacist who has been accused of using hate speech to promote his Christian faith. Liberty University's student handbook, for example, includes a section titled """
817;State the outcome of the Brown v. Board of Education case.;"A state that does not have a school voucher program is required to pay the costs of a public school that is participating in the program. This is known as the ""cost sharing"" requirement. In other words, states have to make up the difference between the amount they spend on public education and the amount they receive in federal aid. The federal government provides $5.3 billion per year in education aid to states, which is split between the states and the federal government. A state that does not have a voucher program is exempt from the cost sharing requirement. This means that the state does not have to pay the full cost of a public school that is participating in the program. States that have opted out of the federal program have the option of using state funds to cover the cost of participating in the program. This option is available to states that are in the middle of a budget crisis, such as those in the Great Recession. The program was created in the wake"
818;Why did the role of the federal government in civil rights enforcement change?;The Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) made it clear that states had the right to set their own policies on race, and that the federal government was a coequal branch of government. This was a watershed moment in the history of civil rights, and has been cited as the turning point that led to the end of Jim Crow laws in the South. What is the most important thing you learned in your time as a federal prosecutor? It's hard to pick one because there are so many factors that go into a prosecutor's job. The first and most important thing is to be a good listener to the people you are charged with enforcing the law. You have to understand what is at stake, and how the law is being applied in your jurisdiction. The second thing is to have a sense of humor about the law and its enforcement. I learned a lot from my colleagues and the cases they brought to the court. How do you feel
819;Do you think the civil rights movement would have been successful in gaining civil rights for African American s without the help of the NAACP and the SCLC? Explain.;A lot of people have asked me that question over the years. I think there are a lot of reasons why it would have been successful, but one of the reasons is that the NAACP was able to mobilize a lot of people to take on the segregationist policies of the Southern Democratic Party and the Ku Klux Klan. That's a big part of it. But it was also the fact that the civil rights movement had an institutional structure in place that made it possible for people to come together and fight for what they believed in. What are some of the most important moments in the history of the civil rights movement? How did you feel about Martin Luther King Jr.'s speech at Riverside Church in Selma, Alabama on March 8, 1965? That was the moment that changed the course of the civil rights movement. It was a very emotional speech, and he was talking about the pain that people were feeling and how they were going to get over it. But the thing that
820;How would you describe Elizabeth Eckford’s demeanor compared to those around her? What might this tell you about her character? Efforts to End Segregation;"Eckford is a black woman in a white-dominated world. Her life is defined by the choices she makes and the consequences of those choices. She has made a series of choices that have led her to this point, and it is up to her to decide how she is going to move forward from here. The first step is to accept her identity as a black woman and her place in the world. This is an important step in any person's life, whether they are white or black, and it is one that Eckford has taken to the fullest extent of her ability. She does not need to change her skin color, but she does need to learn to live with it, and that is a very difficult thing to do. The second step is to understand that there is no ""right"" way to be black, and that the only way to change one's life is to change the way one is living. The third and final step is to realize that you are the only"
821;Take on the role of an African American soldier returning to the United States after fighting in World WarII. Write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper describing your expectations of civil rights as an American citizen.;"In the past, I was a part of a group of African American students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who participated in the Black Student Union (BSU). The BSU was an offshoot of the student union at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and it had its roots in the African American Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to organizing on campus, the BSU had a number of activities to engage the campus community, including a series of ""sit-ins"" in the fall of 1969, which led to the arrest of the university president for obstruction of justice. During the sit-ins, students demanded that the university divest from companies profiting from apartheid and the U.S. government support the South African government in its struggle against Apartheid. The university responded by canceling the remainder of the semester, and a few days later, the student union was shut down. This was the beginning of the end for the Black"
822;Jesse Jackson was;"one of the most vocal critics of the Clinton administration's foreign policy. In a speech at the University of Chicago Law School in October, he said, ""We have a government that is run by and for Wall Street, not Main Street."" Jackson's comments drew a rebuke from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who called them ""dangerous"" and a ""disturbing trend in our politics."" The Clintons have been criticized for their ties to big banks, which they helped raise money for during their time as members of the White House Council on Women and Girls. Bill Clinton, for example, gave $1 million to the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, a charity set up by the mining magnate to promote women's rights in the developing world. The foundation's donors include Goldman Sachs, Citigroup (C), the Carlyle Group (C), BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.L). Hillary Clinton's"
823;Ella Baker was;a student at St. Thomas Aquinas High School in San Antonio. The shooting took place at a high school football game between Texas A&M and Southlake Carroll, according to police. Baker was pronounced dead at the scene. Baker's family released a statement on her death: Our hearts are broken at the loss of Ella Baker. We ask for privacy during this difficult time. Ella was a bright light in our lives and will be missed by all who knew her. She had a passion for helping others and was an avid supporter of her alma mater, St. Thomas Aquinas High School. We are grateful for the outpouring of support from the community and our faith community in the wake of this tragedy. Our prayers are with her family and loved ones during this difficult time. A memorial has been set up at the intersection of South Main Street and West Loop 1604. The location is a few blocks from where police say Baker was shot
824;Civil Rights Act of 196 was;the first of its kind. In 1875, President Ulysses S. Grant signed the Civil Rights Act into law, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability in any place of public accommodation, such as hotels, saloons, theaters, theaters of the first and second class, and other places of public amusement. This act became known as the Freedmen's Bureau Act of 1875. The Civil Rights Act of 1875, as amended in 1878, provided for the enforcement of the provisions of the act by the United States attorney general, a civil rights commission, and federal marshals. The act also provided for the establishment of a national school desegregation commission to investigate complaints of school segregation and to make recommendations to the president of the United States on the desegregation of schools. On March 1, 1878, Congress passed the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
825;Describe the provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 aimed at ending segregation and racial discrimination.;What is the role of the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the enforcement of the Fair Housing Act of 1968? The Department of Justice enforces the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, national origin, age, or disability. It also enforces the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which prohibits discrimination in the provision of goods, services, facilities, or privileges that are necessary for an individual to participate in the labor force or receive equal protection of the laws. In addition, the Department is responsible for enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI), which prohibits discrimination in federally funded programs that receive federal financial assistance (such as education, health care, and social services), and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX), which prohibits discrimination in federally funded education programs that receive federal financial assistance (such as vocational and technical
826;How did television help the civil rights movement?;In the 1960s and 1970s, African Americans were the target of a lot of discrimination in the United States. There were racial and ethnic slurs, police brutality, housing discrimination, the Vietnam War, etcetera. Television gave people a way to express themselves, and that's what the civil rights movement was about. It was about the power of television to change people's minds and hearts. How did television help the women's movement? Women had the right to vote in the United States, but they were denied the right to vote by the men in their families and communities. So they organized to get their vote and the vote of their sisters and sisters-in-law. The women's movement started with a very small group of women, but over the years it grew to include a lot of women and men from all walks of life. What are the most important issues of our time? I think the most important issue of our time is climate
827;How did protesting and lobbying lead to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965?;It was a combination of two things. One was the Supreme Court's decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford in 1857 that the right to vote was a fundamental right of all Americans—that was the basis of the Civil Rights Act of 1866. And that decision had an impact on the South, too. In the South, you had Jim Crow laws that disenfranchised African Americans, and they were used to keep them from voting. So the South was the epicenter of the fight for the Voting Rights Act of 1965. What is the most important thing you learned in your research? I learned that there is no such thing as a free lunch. That's what really struck me. It's not that you get a free lunch, but you have to pay for it. And that's the lesson of the civil rights movement. The people who fought for the rights of African Americans and other people of color were the ones who had to pay for those rights.

829;Chicago Movement was;the first to take advantage of the fact that it was a free country. In 1848, the United States had a population of about 30 million, of which more than one-third were slaves. The abolition of slavery was one of the most important events in American history, and its impact was felt in every corner of the country. It was a watershed moment in the history of the United States. But it took another four years for the movement to gain a foothold in the South. In 1852, for example, there were no slaveholders in the Deep South. But by the 1860s, a number of states had passed laws outlawing slavery, and the South began to secede from the Union. This led to the Civil War, which lasted from 1861 to 1865. The war was fought over the issue of slavery, and many historians have argued that the war was the first time that the issue of slavery was used as a wedge to divide the country.
830;Richard Daley was;one of the most successful directors of his generation. His films are a treasure trove of the kind of character-defining performances that make us fall in love with a movie, and he's a master of suspense, which is why we're here talking about The Shawshank Redemption right now. The story of a man who goes to prison for a crime he didn't commit, Daley created a film that has the power to change the way we think about crime and punishment in the 21st century.

How did you come up with the title for The Shawshank Redemption? I had a friend of mine, a very good friend of mine, who was an art director at Warner Bros. And he said
831;Stokely Carmichael was;"one of the most prolific goal scorers in the Premier League last season. The 29-year-old scored 16 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick against Crystal Palace at the end of the campaign. Carmichael, who has been linked with a move to Manchester United, is out of contract at the end of the season. But his future could be in doubt after Stoke boss Mark Hughes said he would consider selling the striker this summer. Hughes told Sky Sports: ""I've said all along that he's a player that can play for us, but if we're going to spend £30m or £40m on a player, we need to make sure that we're getting the best out of him.

832;Malcolm X was;a black man. I'm going to tell you a story that's going to change your life. You're going to have to sit through it, but it's going to make you a better person in the long run. The story is about Malcolm X's relationship with the Nation of Islam, and how he came to the conclusion that they were the enemy of the United States. Malcolm X had a lot of problems with the Nation of Islam. He was an anti-Semite, and he believed that black people were subhuman. But he also felt that the Nation of Islam was a force for good in the black community. The problem was that Malcolm X was a very charismatic leader, and he used his charisma to get people to follow him. But in order to do that, he had to make a lot of enemies. One of the most important enemies was Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam. Elijah Muhammad was a man
833;Black Panthers was;"the first of its kind to have a ""no guns"" policy. It's a model that has been adopted by a number of law enforcement agencies across the United States, including Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. The idea is that by banning guns from the public, you're less likely to get caught with a gun, which in turn reduces crime. But according to a study published in the Journal of Criminal Justice, that's not the case. In fact, the researchers found that gun bans have no discernible effect on crime rates. ""There is no evidence that a ban on guns leads to reductions in violent crime,"" the study said. The study looked at data from more than 1,000 police departments in the United States, which are required to submit reports to the National Crime Victimization Survey every five years. The researchers used that data to compare the rate of crime in each city before and after they implemented a ban"

835;Summarize the findings of the Kerner Commission.;What is the role of public education in a free society? In the United States, there is a great deal of debate about the role of public education in a free society. Some argue that it is a necessary evil, and should be left to the parents to decide what is best for their children. Others, such as Milton Friedman, advocate a system in which government schools are free to operate as they see fit, and private schools are forced to follow the rules set by the government. The most common argument is that the government should have no role in education at all, and that parents should make the best decisions for their children. This is an interesting and important debate, but it is not the focus of this paper. Instead, we are interested in a more fundamental question: How much responsibility should parents have for the education of their children? The answer to this question is a matter of considerable controversy. On one side, there are those who argue that education should be left
836;How was the Civil Rights Act of 1968designed to help end discrimination?;The law was designed to ensure that African Americans and other minorities were not treated unequally in the United States. In particular, it sought to prevent employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and sexual orientation), national origin, age, disability, genetic information, marital status, political or other opinion, or any other basis that a reasonable person would consider to be irrelevant to employment decisions. What is the Equal Pay Act of 1963? The Equal Pay Act of 1963, signed into law by President John F. Kennedy on Oct. 1, 1963, is a federal law that requires employers to pay women the same as men for equal work. This law has been called the most important piece of civil rights legislation in the 20th century. Who was the first woman to run for president? It was Betty Friedan, who ran for the New York governorship in 1972. Friedan was the first woman to
837;What were the effects of the assassination ofDr. Martin Luther King, Jr.?;"In the years following the assassination, there was a lot of debate about the role of race in the Civil Rights Movement. Some argued that it was a case of ""white flight"" to the South, while others argued that blacks were the victims of a conspiracy to silence them. The most popular theory was that King was killed in order to keep him from speaking out against the Vietnam War and other injustices in the United States. This theory gained traction in the 1960s and '70s, but was debunked by a series of studies that found no evidence of a conspiracy, and that the assassination was the result of a lone gunman acting alone. What was the impact of the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Malcolm X? Kennedy's assassination in 1963 marked the beginning of the Cold War and led to the escalation of the war in Vietnam. The Kennedy assassination was followed by the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968, and the assassination of Robert F."
838;Take on the role of a reporter in the late 1960s. Imagine you have interviewed a follower of Dr. King and a Black Panther member. Write out a transcript of each interview.;What is the most important thing you learned from the interviews? That the police are the enemy of Black people. They kill us, they beat us, they rape us—all for no reason at all. That's the truth. And I was able to get that out of my head, and it was a very liberating experience for me. How did you come to work for Time magazine? My father, an Army veteran, was a newsman in the Vietnam War. He told me about the magazine and how it was going to change the world. I went to college and majored in journalism, and after a couple of years I got a job as a copy boy at the New York Times. That was the beginning of my career in journalism. What are your favorite Time stories? There are so many, but one of my favorites is the cover story on Martin Luther King Jr. in the March 1965 issue. It was a huge story
839;Ho Chi Minh was;"a Vietnamese revolutionary who led the Viet Cong from 1954 to 1975. In his speech to the U.N. General Assembly in September, Trump said the North Korean leader ""will be tested like never before."" ""I have great confidence that my fellow Americans will do what is right and to the glory of God, and they will stop this madness once and for all,"" Trump said. The White House did not provide a copy of Trump's speech, but a transcript was provided to The Associated Press on Friday. In the speech, Trump called Kim Jong Un ""Rocket Man"" and said the United States is ""ready, willing and able"" to take out Kim's regime ""at any time, any place and under any circumstances."" ""Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime, has lost all respect for his neighbors and all nations of the world, including the United States of America,"" Trump said."
840;Dien Bien Phu was;"a city in the south of Vietnam. It was one of the most important cities in the country, and the capital of Hanoi at the time of the French occupation. Dien Bien Phu had an impressive population of more than 10,000 people, but only a few thousand of them lived in the city center. The rest lived in the countryside, and were mostly peasants, working the land and raising livestock. In 1894, the French occupied the city, and by the end of the war, most of the city was under French control. After the French were defeated in the Second Indochina War (1946-1954), the government decided to build a hospital and other facilities in the city, which they called ""Bien Phu"" (meaning ""City of Peace""). The hospital was built in two phases, one for the military and the other for the civilian population. The first phase of the hospital included a medical school, an intensive care unit"
841;Ngo Dinh Diem was;"a South Vietnamese general who led the U.S. invasion of North Vietnam. In his memoir, ""Dirty Wars,"" former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld wrote that Diem ""took the war to the enemy, using every tool at his disposal to win the war."" The United States had no intention of leaving Vietnam, Rumsfeld wrote, ""but we did want to end the war as soon as possible."" ""The war was going to end in a stalemate, not a victory,"" he wrote. ""And that was a fact that was known to all of us in the White House and the Pentagon."" Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a Supreme Court justice from 1986 to 1993, said in a speech last year at the University of California, Los Angeles, that she would vote for Trump if he were the nominee.

843;Government and Democracy Why did Ngo Dinh Diem refuse to hold country-wide elections in Vietnam in 1956?;Vietnam's political system is based on a tripartite system of legislative, executive and judicial branches. The legislature is elected by the people, who elect the president and vice-president. There are two types of seats in the legislature: regular (congressional) and non-regular (parliamentary). The president is elected for a four-year term and has the power to make laws and appoint and dismiss government officials. The executive branch consists of the prime minister, cabinet and executive council. The cabinet is made up of members of the cabinet and a president-designate who serves as the head of government. The executive council is made up of the president, vice-president, speaker of the National Assembly and other senior officials. In addition, there are several advisory bodies, such as the Commission on Human Rights and the National Assembly of the People's Republic of China (NAPC), which provide advice to the president on policy matters. The NAPC is an
844;Why do you think the United States supported the government of Ngo Dinh Diem?;A lot of people have a hard time thinking about the U.S. role in South Vietnam. It's hard to believe that a country that was the largest producer of food and a major exporter of oil would turn its back on the people of South Vietnam, who were suffering under the rule of the North Vietnamese and the Viet Minh for the better part of two decades. But that's what happened. The United States did everything it could to help the South Vietnamese fight the North Vietnamese and the Viet Minh. It provided arms, training, logistical support, and other forms of assistance that were critical to the South Vietnamese war effort. How much money did the CIA spend on the war? I'm not sure how much was spent, but there's no question that the CIA played a significant role in the war. The CIA had a lot of people working on this, including the director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, who was in charge of the CIA at
845;How would you describe the contrast between American and Vietnamese societies? How do you think this contrast influenced American thinking toward the war?;A lot of Americans were shocked to see Vietnamese people fighting for their country, and that's a shock to the American psyche. It's hard to explain, but I think the Vietnam War was an American war in a way that no other war has been in the history of the United States. It had a lot of similarities to the Civil War, in that both were civil wars, both involved large numbers of people who were willing to take a stand for what they believed in—in this case, the right to self-determination for the Vietnamese people. And in both cases, the American public was very divided on the issue, and there was a lot of anger and frustration among the American public at the fact that Vietnam was going to be a free and independent country, and that it was going to have a democratic government and not be ruled by the United States. So, for Americans, this was a very, very different kind of war than the war in Vietnam was. And,

847;Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was;the most controversial of the war. In the summer of 1964, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (H. Res. 498), which called for U.S. forces to fire on North Vietnamese ships in the Gulf of Tonkin if they crossed the 38th parallel, a distance of 1,200 miles (2,400 km). This would have been illegal under international law, but the president had no intention of going to war over it. Instead, he used the resolution to pressure Congress to approve a $1.5 billion war bond to pay for the war and to give him the authority to send troops into Vietnam without congressional approval. On August 4, 1964, a group of about 100 antiwar protesters in San Clemente, California, set fire to a Vietnamese flag that had been flown over the home of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-New York), the senator from California who was running for president that year. The protest was part
848;Agent Orange was;a defoliant used by the U.S. military to contaminate herbicide-tolerant crops. It caused cancer in test animals and led to birth defects in human children. In the past, Monsanto has been accused of covering up the dangers of Agent Orange, but this is the first time the company has been found to have lied to the public about the health effects of its herbicide. Monsanto's response to the lawsuit is expected to be made public in the coming weeks.
849;Ho Chi Minh trail was;"the first to open. In the 1970s and 1980s, Vietnam veterans and their families began to build trails in Hanoi, Saigon and Ho Chi Minh City. These trails became known as ""Vietnam trails"" and the name stuck for a long time. But as time went on, many of the trails were paved over, with some still in use today. Today, there are over 1,000 trails in Vietnam, including more than 100 that are open to the public. Here are some of the most popular trails in Vietnam: 1. The Long Binh Trail, Vietnam This is one of the most popular trails in Vietnam, and it's a must-do for anyone who wants to see the city from the air.

852;Why did fighting in Vietnam turn into a stalemate by the mid-1960s?;It was because the United States was in the midst of a Cold War with the Soviet Union, which at that time had a nuclear arsenal of more than 1,000 warheads. In order to maintain the status quo, the U.S. had to keep its adversaries on the defensive and deter them from attacking the United States. This meant that Vietnam was the most important theater of the Cold War, and the only one in which the Soviets and the North Vietnamese were willing to fight each other to a standstill. What was the Vietnam War like for American servicemen and women? During the war, there were more than 2 million casualties, including more than 100,000 Americans. Many of the casualties were due to the lack of medical care, food rations, and other supplies that were available to the troops. The war also had a devastating impact on the morale of the American people, who felt that their country had lost its way in the Vietnam War—and that the
853;Imagine that you are a member of Congress in August196;"Imagine that you are a member of Congress in August196. The government is spending $1 billion a year to fight Ebola in West Africa and it has a budget of $1.2 trillion. That means that the U.S. government is spending more than a trillion dollars on the war on Ebola, which is the most expensive war in American history.

So what's the solution? The answer is simple: Congress should pass a law that allows the president to declare a national emergency, which is a temporary suspension of the Constitution's separation of powers and allows the president to take any action he or she sees fit without congressional approval. This would mean that President Obama could use the power of the emergency declaration to suspend immigration from Ebola-stricken countries, including the United States, for 90 days. The suspension would be in effect until Congress could pass a new law to reinstate the suspension.

If Congress fails to pass a new law in 90 days, the suspension would remain in effect until January 1, 2015 at the latest. If Congress"
854;Write a statement supporting or opposing the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.;"In the past, I have voted to support the United States and its allies in the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (H. Res. 461), which called for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam and a cease-fire between North Vietnam and the Viet Cong. However, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am concerned that the resolution was a ""blank check"" to the President to go to war without congressional approval. In my view, this is an abuse of the power of the Congress and should be subject to the approval of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Vote in favor of the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998. This is a bill that would provide $1.5 billion to the Iraqi people for reconstruction after the war, and $500 million of this money would go to Iraq's oil industry. The bill is supported by the American Petroleum Institute (API), a trade association representing oil companies in the Middle East and North Africa."
855;William Westmoreland was;one of the most influential men in the United States. He served as Secretary of State under John Quincy Adams and was a member of the Constitutional Convention that drafted the U.S. Constitution in 1787.[1] Westmoreland's life was filled with controversy, as he was accused of treason and other charges in 1804, but the charges were dropped after a jury found him not guilty of the charges in June 1805. In 1806, he was elected to the House of Representatives from New York, and served until his death in 1848 at the age of seventy-five. Biography [ edit ] Early life [ edit ] Born in the town of Staunton, Virginia, on January 1, 1759, William Westmoreland was the son of a slave and a free woman, and grew up in a family of slave owners. His father owned land in Virginia, and the family moved to Virginia to work on the land and make a
856;Tet offensive was;the best of the bunch. It's hard to say what would have happened if the Jets had scored a touchdown on the first play of the second half, but I'm not going to make a prediction based on that play. The game was tied at 14-14 at that point, and the Jets would have needed at least one touchdown to win the game. Instead, they got two, and that's all that matters in the long run. That being said, there were a lot of positives to take away from the game. For one, the Jets were able to run the ball for the first time all season, and they did a good job of getting the ball to Bilal Powell on third down. Powell finished with nine carries for 53 yards and a touchdown, which is good for second in the NFL among running backs with at least 50 carries. Peyton Hillis, on the other hand, was a non-factor in the passing game. He completed
857;Summarize three important events that occurred in 196;"Summarize three important events that occurred in 196.

The first was the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 B.C. by his son Octavian. The Romans were at war with Carthage, and Julius Caesar was trying to negotiate peace with the Carthaginians. Octavian had a plan to get rid of Caesar, and it involved the assassination of a Roman senator named Gaius Gracchus. This was an important event in the history of Rome, and it is one of the reasons why the Roman Empire lasted so long.

The second event was the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century A.D. This was a time of civil war in the Roman Empire, and many of the people who had been loyal to the Roman Empire were forced to flee to the East. These people were called Goths, and they came to be known as the Huns. The Huns were nomadic tribes that lived in the steppes of Central Asia, and they had no written language, so"
858;Why did many people believe that the Vietnam War reflected racial and economic injustices in the United States?;It's hard to say, but I think the most important factor was fear of losing one's job, which was a big motivator for many people. And then there was the war itself, which was an extremely unpopular war at the time. It had to do with the fact that we were in a war with North Vietnam, which was the enemy of the United States, and that the U.S. had no right to intervene militarily in that part of the world without the approval of the international community. What was the reaction to the bombing of Hanoi in the spring of 1968? The bombing of Hanoi was a huge shock to the Vietnamese people, and they felt that the United States was trying to take advantage of them and that they needed to be strong and protect themselves. So they were very angry and very angry at the bombing, and that's what led to the Tet Offensive, which lasted until the end of 1968. How did
859;Why did support of the Vietnam War begin to dwindle by the late 1960s?;It was a combination of factors, I think. First, the Cold War was coming to an end, and people were looking for a way to avoid the risk of nuclear war. Second, there was a lot of anti-communism in the United States at that time. And third, the war in Vietnam had become a symbol of America's commitment to the world and its values. It was an important part of the American identity. What was the most surprising thing you learned about your subject during your research? One of the things that surprised me was that the Vietnamese are very good at reading people's emotions—they know what people are thinking and how they are feeling. And that's a very different thing from other people in the world, who have to rely on a lot of information about the outside world and their own feelings. How did you get to know Nguyen Thi Huong, the subject of your book? I was working on a book
860;Graphs During what two years was opposition to the war lowest? What event occurred around that time?;A few of the questions are easy to answer, but the rest are not. I have a list of all the things that happened in the first two years of the war, and I'm going to give you my opinion on each of them. This is not a comprehensive list, but it should give you a sense of what's going on and why people are against the war. First, let's look at the question of opposition to the war. In a Gallup poll taken in April and May of 1945, just a month after Pearl Harbor, the percentage of Americans who said they disapproved of the war was at 42 percent. That's a lot lower than it was in the early 1940s, when it was over 50 percent. But it was still pretty high at the time, and there were a lot of reasons for that. One was that the United States was in a war with Japan, and it was hard to get people to approve of a war that was going on
861;Generalizing In what year did opposition to the Vietnam War peak? How was this sentiment logically related to the withdrawal of American troops?;A number of factors are at work in this question, which I will attempt to address in the next section. First, there is a long-standing and well-understood tradition of antiwar sentiment in the United States. This has its roots in the Civil War, which was fought to end slavery, and its continuance after the end of the war is a matter of historical record. It was not until the 1960s that opposition to the war reached a peak, and that peak was in large part due to the rise of the Black Power movement in the 1960s and 1970s. In addition, the Cold War and the Vietnam War are the most recent examples of an era in which public opinion has been shaped by events outside the realm of political debate. These events, however, do not explain the current level of opposition to the war, nor do they provide a basis for an analysis of the reasons for it. The first factor that must be considered is the historical and political

First, you go to the cemetery and look for your mother's gravestone. If there is no gravestone, you call the cemetery and ask for a copy of the obituary that was written for your mother. The copy will be in Greek, which is the language of the deceased. You can read the obituary in Greek, but it is not a good idea to do so, because you will have to memorize it. Next, you go to the Greek-speaking priest, who will tell you what to do. The priest will ask you a series of questions, such as ""How old were you when you were born?"" and ""What was your father's name?"" You will answer these questions truthfully, and he will give you a piece of paper with"

If you are a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, make a public statement of your support or opposition to the Vietnam War. This statement should be in the form of a letter to the editor, and you should include your name, rank, and serial number (if any). The following is an example of a letter to the editor that the United States Marine Corps sent to the San Francisco Chronicle on February 1, 1967: ""Marines in Vietnam have a right to be proud of their service and to express their views in a free and open manner. However, it is the duty of the Marine Corps to maintain a high standard of moral conduct and conduct itself in a manner that does not reflect unfavorably upon the United States or its armed forces, and in this regard we are compelled to state that we do not agree with the policy of the United"
864;Henry Kissinger was;"in the White House when the U.S. invaded Grenada in 1983. Kissinger's son-in-law, Elliott Abrams, served as a special assistant to President George H.W. Bush from 1989 to 1993. In that capacity, Abrams helped orchestrate the coup that overthrew Salvador Allende in Chile, a move that would lead to the death of tens of thousands of Chileans and the rise of Pinochet's dictatorship. Abrams is a member of the Trilateral Commission, a group of business and political leaders who meet every two years to discuss ways to ""modernize"" the world's economic and political systems. The Trilateral Commission has been described as the ""principal think tank of the United States and its allies in the European Union and the Middle East."" Kissinger and Abrams were key players in orchestrating the invasion of Grenada in 1983 and the subsequent military coup that installed a right-wing dictator, Maurice Bishop,"
865;Pentagon Papers was;"a big deal. I remember the first time I read it in high school, it was like ""Holy shit, this is the most important book in the history of the United States of America."" And then it became this thing that people were talking about for a long time, and then the NSA came out and said, ""No, we're not going to do that."" And that was kind of a turning point for me as a journalist and an American who's interested in this stuff. So what's your take on Snowden's decision to go to Hong Kong, where he's wanted by the Chinese government for a variety of crimes? Well, the idea of a whistle-blower is a noble one, and it's one that has been used to great effect by people who have risked their lives to expose wrongdoing. But there are a lot of things that go into that decision, and I think Snowden's motivations are a little unclear at this point. One"

""I'm going to do everything I can to make sure this never happens again,"" he said in a video posted on his Facebook page. The White House did not return a request for comment on Trump's comments. Trump has made no secret of his disdain for the Iraq War, which he called ""a disaster"" during his campaign. But he has been a vocal supporter of the Iran nuclear deal, which the Obama administration brokered in 2015 with the help of six world powers. The deal is seen as a victory for Iran, which was able to avoid a military confrontation with the United States and its allies by curbing its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate who took office in 2013, said last month"
867;Describe what happened in Vietnam in 1975 after the United States withdrew.;"I was in Saigon at the time and it was a very difficult time for the Vietnamese people. They were under attack by the North Vietnamese army and the Viet Cong, which was a guerrilla group in the South. The U.S. had been there for a number of years and they wanted to leave, but there was a lot of resistance to that. And I had a chance to go to the embassy and meet with the ambassador, Robert McNamara, and he said, ""We're going to pull out of Vietnam in six months, and you're going to take over the embassy."" And I said, ""What do you mean by that?"" He said, ""Well, if you want to be a diplomat, you have to do something about this problem."" And that's what I did. What was your role in that? I was one of the people who was assigned to work on the embassy, and I was responsible for getting the embassy up and running"
868;Why did Congress pass the War Powers Act? How did this act reflect a struggle between the legislative and executive branches?;It was the result of a compromise between two factions in the Democratic Party that had come to power in the mid-1930s. One faction, led by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, wanted to end the war in Europe and return to the peacemaking that had been the hallmark of the New Deal. The other faction, led by Harry S. Truman, wanted to keep the United States in the war, at least for a while. In order to do that, they had to find a way to make it legal for the president to use military force without congressional approval. This was a difficult task, because Congress had never passed a law that gave the president the power to go to war without Congress's approval. The compromise was to have the president declare war on a country that did not have a formal declaration of war, and then Congress would have 60 days to decide whether or not to ratify the war. If Congress did not ratify the war, the president would be allowed
869;Why did the invasion of Cambodia cost President Nixon congressional support?;"In a letter to the New York Times on March 1, 1973, Nixon's national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote that the invasion of Cambodia was ""one of the most important events of the 1970s and a turning point in American foreign policy."" He went on to say that ""we had no choice but to go to war in Indochina,"" and that Nixon ""did not want to be the one who lost the war to Khmer Rouge and Viet Minh, but he was forced to take the lead in this war by the pressure of public opinion in the United States and the international community."" Brzezinski's argument was based on the fact that, as a result of the Cambodian invasion, there was a ""dramatic increase in anti-American and anti-Communist sentiment in South Vietnam, which led to the fall of Saigon in 1975 and the end of the Cold War."" But what was the evidence that this was the case?"
870;Imagine that you are a college student in 1970. Write a journal entry expressing your feelings about the events at Kent State University and Jackson State College.;"What would you write in your journal about the Kent State shootings? How would you have reacted if you were a student at Kent State in 1970? The answers to these questions are important for understanding the motivations of today's gun violence. For example, a student who had no involvement in the shooting would have been unlikely to write about it, but an active shooter or mass shooter would have had a different motivation. In other words, they would have wanted to kill as many people as possible in order to inflict maximum pain and suffering on their victims. This is what we see in the media and on the Internet, where people post videos of themselves shooting people and then claim that they were defending themselves or their loved ones. What is the most important lesson we can learn from this history? It is that we need to stop talking about ""good guys with guns"" and start talking about ""bad guys with guns."" The media is full of people who say that guns are the"

In a press release, Dr. David Schindler, president of the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), the organization that conducted the study, said the findings are ""deeply troubling."" ""We need to be clear about what is at stake,"" Schindler said on behalf of the CIHI. ""This is not a case of 'one size fits all' approach to drinking water. It is an issue of prioritization, and a need for a national approach that is based on science rather than political expediency.""

872;Tom Hayden was;one of the most prolific scorers in the history of the AFL. He scored 1,724 goals, the most by a player in one season since the AFL-AFL Coaches Association (now AFLCAA) was formed in 1987-88 to promote the game of footy. Hayden's record-breaking season was a watershed moment for the game, but it was not without its bumps and bruises. In the early stages of the season, Hayden suffered a broken leg in round one, which required surgery to repair. The following week, he was forced to sit out the rest of the season after breaking his leg again. He returned to the field in round 17, but his leg was in a cast for six weeks and he had to wear a walking boot for the rest of the season. Hayden was a key part of Hawthorn's premiership-winning side in 1997-98, and played a key role in the club

The ban was put in place in the 1970s after a series of high-profile cases of lung cancer in San Francisco, which had the highest rate of smoking in the United States. But it has been a long time coming, said Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor of epidemiology at UCSF who has studied the health effects of smoking for 30 years. ""I think it's going to take a lot of people to get the message across,"" Siegel said. ""There's no one smoking-free city, but we're making progress."" Siegel's research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine last year, found that people who live in smoke-free neighborhoods are less likely to die from heart disease, cancer and other types of cancer than those who live in areas with high rates of smoking. In addition, the more smoke-free a neighborhood is, the lower the risk of"
874;Jimi Hendrix was;"a genius. I think it's fair to say that the world has changed a lot since he died in January of '77. He had an incredible life, and his legacy is one of the most influential musicians of all time. But it's hard to think of anyone who's done more to change the way we look at music, and what it means to be a human being. Hendrix was the first rock star to take the concept of ""art"" to a whole new level, and that's a big part of what made him so special. The music industry is in a state of flux these days, and there's no shortage of people trying to make a buck off the new wave of music that's coming out of the '80s and '90s. The problem is that a lot of people are making music for the wrong reasons. They're doing it because they want to be famous, or they're doing it because they have a passion"
875;Summarize two legacies of the counterculture movement.;"What is the counterculture? It's a term coined by sociologist Richard Hofstadter in the 1960s to describe the ""new left"" that emerged in the United States and other Western countries after World War II. Hofstadter's definition of the counterculture was that it was characterized by a lack of belief in the authority of the state, an emphasis on individualism, and opposition to social and economic institutions that were perceived as corrupting the individual. In other words, the counterculture was anti-authoritarian, anti-statist, and anti-social. Hoover, on the other hand, was a proponent of the state as the source of social order and order in all its forms. Hoover believed that the state was necessary to protect the nation from the dangers of communism and other forms of social disorder, and that its role was to provide a safety net for the working class and middle class in the face of economic and social instability. He believed that the"

The case at hand is United States v. O'Brien, in which the Court ruled that the government cannot force speech that is protected by the First Amendment to be suppressed in order to protect the government from ""subversive"" speech. This is a very important case for two reasons. First, it establishes that there is a distinction between government suppression of speech and the free speech rights of individuals. And second, it sets a precedent that will be used by future cases that deal with the question of what is and is not a ""true threat."" Why do you think the government is trying to suppress the speech of the Free Speech Movement? It's hard to say why they want to do this. They've made it clear that they're going to use the threat of jail time as a way of silencing dissent, and that's the kind of speech that's at the"
877;How were hippies different from members of the New Left?;"Hippies were a different kind of movement. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was a lot of talk about the ""third way"" between capitalism and communism, which was supposed to be the way to go. But the reality was that it was a very narrow way of looking at the world and not a whole lot of people took it seriously at the time. What was it like to be a hippie in the '60s? I was an 18-year-old kid who lived in San Francisco, and I had no idea what was going on. I thought it was cool to wear leather jackets and go to the Fillmore, but that was the only place you could get a beer and smoke a joint. It was a very strange time in my life. How did you end up working for Rolling Stone? My friend and I were hanging out one night at a house that was owned by a couple of hippies, and"
878;Why did the counterculture movement decline?;In the 1960s and 1970s, there was a lot of interest in the hippie movement, which was the anti-Vietnam War movement. But the counterculture movement had an intellectual and political dimension to it as well. It was a very different kind of movement than the one we're talking about today. What's the difference between today's counterculture and the counterculture of the 1960s? The counterculture of the 1960s was much more focused on social justice issues, such as civil rights and women's rights. Today, it's much more of a consumerist movement, with a lot of people looking for things to buy and not much attention to the political and social issues that were important to the counterculture of the 1960s. Why do you think this is happening? I think it's the same thing that happened in the '60s: people are tired of being told what to do and how to live their lives.
879;How does the bus itself represent values of the counterculture? Youth Movement Causes;"and Consequences (YMC), a group that promotes ""social justice"" by organizing protests, has published a list of signs that they hope will be placed on the bus: 1. Black Lives Matter is a hate group. 2. The police are killing black people at a rate that is three times the rate of white people. 3. We need to stop being racist and start being human. 4. Black people have the right to live in peace and dignity without fear of being killed by the police. 5. We are the 99% and the 1% are the 1%. This is the kind of rhetoric that is common in today's political climate, and it seems to fit the needs of the youth movement in a way that they can get away with. The problem is that these signs are not just offensive, they are dangerous to the people who live in the communities they are meant to represent. In the case of the bus,"

Write an article in which you visit a commune and describe the hippie culture you see.;"What would you say to the reader who asks, ""Why didn't you go to the commune?"" I would say, ""Because it was illegal, you know."" And that's the point of this article. It's not a question of whether or not you went to an illegal commune, but a question of why you chose to go to an illegal commune in the first place. The answer is simple: you wanted to be part of something bigger than yourself. And that something is a community of like-minded people who share a common goal: to live in harmony with nature and each other. In other words, it's the same reason people join religious congregations, political parties, sports teams, and so on. They want to be part of something that has a larger purpose than themselves. This is what makes it so hard to break the taboo on psychedelics. We have been conditioned to think that they are bad for us,"
881;Equal Pay Act was;"passed in 1963. The Equal Pay Act requires employers to pay women the same as men for equal work, regardless of sex. In 2015, women made 77 cents for every dollar a man made, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's a drop from 2014, when it was 78 cents on the dollar. But the gap has widened in recent years, with women's pay growing at a faster rate than men's since the 1970s and 1980s. ""We're going to have to do a better job of recruiting and retaining women,"" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said at a news conference in the Capitol last week. She was joined by Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the ranking Democrat on the House Education and the Workforce Committee.

""We must do better than this,"" he said. ""It is time for Republicans and Democrats to come together and work together to make America great again."" Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have been vocal about their opposition to Trump's executive order on immigration, which has sparked protests across the country. The White House did not say what would happen to the program that provides work permits to foreign nationals who meet certain requirements, such as language proficiency, criminal history and military service. It is a key part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which Trump rescinded in September."
883;Betty Friedan was;a feminist. Feminism is the belief that women are equal to men in every way, and that the best way to achieve that equality is through the empowerment of women. It has nothing to do with gender roles, and everything to do with equal rights and opportunities for all women. In other words, feminists believe that women should be treated the same as men, regardless of their gender, race, sexual orientation, ability, etc. This is a good thing, and one that should be encouraged by the government, not stifled by it. The fact that a woman's body is her own property does not change that fact at all. It is the government's job to protect the rights of women, not to take away their rights.

Hogue's comments come after a White House official told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was ""the right thing to do."" The president announced the end of the program in a series of tweets on Tuesday, calling it ""a slap in the face to the millions of hardworking immigrants who came to this country to make a better life for themselves and their families.""

She also advocated a ban on abortion in cases of rape and incest, and for ""family planning"" to be used as a form of birth control. In an interview with National Review's Jonah Goldberg last year, Schlafly said, ""The idea that a woman has a right to an abortion is an abomination to the Christian faith and a perversion of the natural law.""

But there are still a lot of barriers that women are having to overcome, such as not being paid the same as men for the same work, being discriminated against in the workplace, and having to deal with a hostile work environment.

One of the things that was really interesting to me was the extent to which people's attitudes toward women are shaped by how they are taught in school and what they see in the media. For example, in the United States, the majority of girls and women are taught that women are inferior to men in every way—from physical strength to intelligence to leadership ability. This is a very common message that is taught in schools, and it has a huge impact on how people view women and women's rights.
888;What two events weakened the women’s movement after1920?;The first was the rise of the working class in the United States. This was a process that began in 1848 with the election of Abraham Lincoln, who won the presidency in 1864 on the back of a wave of anti-slavery sentiment. In the years that followed, the struggle for women's suffrage grew in intensity and became an issue of national and international importance. It was not until the mid-1930s that the issue was taken up by the labor movement as a central part of its struggle to improve working conditions and raise living standards for all workers. The second event was the Great Depression of the 1930s and the resulting economic crisis that swept the country. During this period, women suffered the worst economic downturn in the history of the United States, with unemployment reaching 25 percent in the summer of 1931 and continuing to rise through the rest of the decade. The Depression had a devastating impact on women's ability to earn a living, especially in the manufacturing sector

Bakke's death was the second in as many years for a pilot who had served in the United States Air Force. The other was that of Capt. David Buell, who died of a heart attack at the age of 42 in May of this year. In addition to his work as a pilot, Bakke was an avid golfer, and a member of the PGA Tour for the past 20 years. He played in the 2008 and 2012 Ryder Cup tournaments, as well as the 2011 U.S. Open. ""We are saddened to learn of the passing of Allan Bakke,"" the PGA of America said in a statement.

Richmond's comments come after President Donald Trump's press secretary Sean Spicuzza told reporters on Tuesday that ""there's no place for that kind of behavior in our society,"" referring to the violence that broke out at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Spicuzza added that Trump ""stands with the people of Charlottesville and condemn[s] in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides."" ""We cannot allow a moral equivalency to be drawn between white supremacists and counterprotesters,"" Richmond said in a statement. ""This is not a debate"
892;César Chávez was;a hero to the poor. But it is a lie to say that his policies were the cause of the poverty that afflicts Venezuela today. In fact, he did nothing to help the poor, except in the short term, by providing food and medicine to those who needed it. The poor have been suffering for a long time, and Chávez was no different. Chávez, however, had a vision of a better future for Venezuela, and that vision was based on the belief that Venezuela could be a model for the rest of Latin America. He believed that by taking the oil money from the United States and redistributing it to the poor, he could create a prosperous and prosperous country that would serve as a model for other countries to follow. The problem with this vision is that it is not a realistic one at all. Venezuela is in a state of economic and political crisis that is beyond the control of any government, let alone one that claims to be

894;American Indian Movement was;"the first to call for the abolition of slavery. In 1838, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Dred Scott v. Sandford that African Americans were not citizens of the United States and could not be denied the right to vote. This decision was a watershed in the history of race relations in the United States, and led to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and '70s. Today, there are more than 1.5 million Native Americans living in the United States, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The number of Native Americans is expected to grow to more than 2 million by 2040 as a result of immigration from other countries such as Mexico, South America and the Caribbean.

895;Analyze how the Bakke case, along with other cases, affected affirmative action.;"What is the impact of race and ethnicity on college admissions? In a nutshell, it's hard to overstate the impact of race and ethnicity on college admissions. For one thing, there are a lot of factors that go into a college's decision to admit students, such as financial need, test scores, extracurricular activities (like sports) and other factors. These factors are not the same for all students, of course, but the fact that race and ethnicity play a role is clear. For another thing, race and ethnicity have an outsized impact on the number of students who get into college and the kinds of colleges that are able to attract them. The higher the percentage of African-Americans and Hispanics in a college's student body, the more likely it is that the college will have a large number of black and Hispanic students and the fewer students of other races and ethnicities it enrolls. This is a result of the ""holistic approach"" that"

897;Why have African Americans become significantly more influential in the U.S. Congress since the early 1970s?;One answer is that they have done so in a way that is consistent with the long-term trend of declining representation of African Americans in the United States Congress (Hirsch et al., 2012). This trend is not a new phenomenon, but it has been driven by changes in the composition of the U.S. population over the past two decades, as well as a number of policy changes that have made it easier for African Americans to gain political power and access to elected office. In the first half of the 20th century, there was a steady decline in the number of African Americans in state and local government, from a high of more than one-third of the total in 1820 to less than 10 percent in the mid-twentieth century (see Figure 1). The number of African Americans in Congress declined as well, from a high of more than 30 percent in the late 19th century to less than 10 percent in the early 20th century (see Figure 2). This
898;Write a magazine article about the conditions that gave rise to the Native American protest movement of the 1960s and 1970s.;What's your background? Do you have a college degree? How did you get into journalism? I graduated from a community college in New York, where I majored in English and was a member of the Young Americans for Freedom (YAF, a student group that protested the Vietnam War in the early 1960s). After that, I went to the University of California at Berkeley to get my master's degree in political science. In my spare time, I wrote a couple of articles for the student newspaper, The Spokesman-Review, and I worked as a copy editor for an editorial-writing firm for a few years. When I was in graduate school, I started to think about what it would be like to be a journalist in the United States and how I could contribute to that conversation. One of the things that struck me was the lack of interest in the American Indian movement that I was seeing in the news, and that's when I decided to do something
899;Southern strategy was;"to take advantage of the fact that there was no one in the area who knew what was going on. In order to do this, they needed a way to keep the people from getting to the information, and that was the secret of the Black Dragon Mountain Pass. It was an extremely difficult task for a group of five people to go through the mountain pass, but the group had been able to accomplish it in a short amount of time. After all, they were the ones who had the most to gain from this secret. ""You're right, I should have told you about this earlier."" Ye Zichen looked at Lin Ruoxi with a smile.

Canada's corporate tax rate is the highest in the G7, at 35 per cent. But that's not the only factor that affects business decisions. A Canadian company's ability to move jobs to other countries depends on the country of origin, as well as how much it pays in taxes. The U.S. and Britain are among the countries with the highest corporate tax rates, with the U.S. top at 35 per cent and the U.K.'s at 28 per cent.

901;Describe Nixon’s New Federalism policy.;Nixon was a conservative, but he did not want to be the leader of the free world. In the 1960s and 1970s, he worked with Democrats to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which ended Jim Crow in the United States. But the Democratic Party had lost its power and was no longer in the White House. Nixon's goal was to restore the party to power by making it more conservative and less dependent on labor unions. What is the most important issue facing the country today? It's the deficit. We have a $16 trillion national debt, and that's the highest in history. The federal government is spending more than it takes in every year to pay for Social Security, Medicare, veterans' benefits, interest on the national debt, and all the other things that we need to be doing in order to get our economy going again. How would you solve the deficit? I would cut taxes on middle-class families, but
902;What were the results of Nixon’s policy of détente?;Nixon and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev signed the Agreed Framework on October 26, 1972. The agreement was a joint effort to reduce tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union in the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis, which had been sparked by U.S. intelligence reports that the Soviets were preparing to launch a nuclear attack on the United States. In exchange for the reduction of nuclear arsenals, the United States agreed to withdraw from the ABM Treaty (an arms control treaty that limits the number of nuclear weapons each country can possess) and to allow the Soviets to build a missile defense system in Europe. What was the Soviet response to the agreement? The Soviet Union reacted with a series of retaliatory measures, including the invasion of Czechoslovakia in October 1973, the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade in November and the assassination of President Salvador Allende in Chile the following month. By the end of 1973, the Soviet Union
903;How did Nixon’s China visit affect Soviet relations?;"Nixon was in China to attend the G-20 summit in Hangzhou, and the Chinese had a lot to say about his visit. In a speech to the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai said, ""I am pleased to welcome you to the Republic of China, and look forward to your friendship and co-operation in the fields of trade, science and technology, and cultural and other fields."" Zhou Enlai's words were followed by an official communiqué from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, which read in part: ""China and the United States have a long-standing and mutually beneficial relationship based on mutual respect and mutual benefit. The two countries are bound by the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and we hope to continue this relationship to the benefit of both countries and the world at large.""

He led the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), a group of student activists who fought for civil rights in the South and the United States. In his speech at the University of Missouri, Dean said the university should have done more to protect students who were ""threatened with violence"" and called for a ""thorough investigation"" into the incident. ""I am outraged that this kind of behavior is allowed to go unpunished,"" Dean said. ""It is a stain on our university and the reputation of our institution. We must hold ourselves to a higher standard, and that standard must be zero tolerance for this kind of behavior."" Dean's comments drew criticism from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which issued a statement on Monday condemning Dean's remarks. ""Dean's comments do not reflect the values of the University of Missouri, which prides itself on being a welcoming and inclusive place"

908;Evaluate the effects of the Watergate scandal on the way American citizens viewed the federal government.;Find out what happened to Richard Nixon after he resigned from the presidency in 1974. Explore the history of the United States from the founding of the nation to the present day. The course is designed for students who have completed at least one course in political science, American history, or a related field. Students will be expected to demonstrate proficiency in the following skills: (1) critical thinking, (2) problem solving, (3) oral and written communication skills, (4) the use of evidence to support one's position, (5) writing in a style that is accessible to nonstudents, and (6) a sense of history as a process rather than a series of events. This course meets once a week for one semester and is open to all students in good standing at UC Santa Cruz. The instructor is Dr. Robert Cialdini, professor of political science and director of the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy (CSED).
909;How did the Watergate scandal alter the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of government?;I think it did, in a number of ways. One of the most important was the fact that Nixon was able to take advantage of the scandal to push through a series of executive orders that were aimed at curtailing civil liberties and the right to vote. These included the National Security Agency (NSA), which was the precursor to the NSA today, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which gave the government the power to wiretap anyone in the United States without a warrant. And the other thing that happened was that Congress, which had been in the hands of Republicans for a long time, began to change its mind about the war in Vietnam—and that's a big deal in the history of the American political system. The Republican Party has had a long history of supporting the military-industrial complex, and they were not going to let that go without a fight. So they passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964, which was a vote of no confidence in South Vietnam
910;How did the discovery of the White House tapes change the Watergate cover-up investigation?;"In a word, nothing. It was an accident of history that the tapes were discovered by a group of reporters working for the Washington Post, which at the time was under the control of Nixon's chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman. Nixon had ordered the Post to stop publishing the White House tapes, and Haldeman's orders were obeyed. The Post's editor, Ben Bradlee, and his deputy, Robert Novak, were in the room when the tape was turned over to them. Bradlee and Novak, along with Post executive editor Leonard Downie, decided to make a copy of the tape, which they handed to the FBI for analysis. The FBI's analysis showed that there was no smoking gun, and that the tape was inauthentic. It did not contain Nixon's ""smoking gun"" conversation with HSCA lawyer John Dean, nor did it contain a recording of Nixon saying, ""I'm going to get you, you son of"

The accords, which came into force on 1 January, are aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting renewable energy, among other things. Finnish President Sauli Niinistämö said in a statement: ""I am pleased that the EU has agreed to work with Finland on climate change and the energy transition.

913;Department of Energy was;the first to use it in a test. It has been a long time coming, but the technology is finally coming to fruition. In the past few years, researchers have made progress in the development of graphene, a form of carbon that is one of the strongest materials known to man. But until now, no one knew how to make it conductive, which is the key to making a supercapacitor. Now, a team of researchers led by University of California, San Diego (UCSD) materials scientist and graphene expert John Doudna has found a way to do just that. Their work is published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology. Graphene's strength comes from its ability to absorb and emit electrons when it comes in contact with an electric field. This property, known as band gap, allows the material to conduct electricity without losing its electrical properties and, in some cases, becoming a dead battery. The researchers, working with the National
914;Identify the achievement and failure President Carter experienced in the Middle East during his administration.;What is the most important lesson you learned from this experience? It's a lesson that has to be learned by every president of the United States. We are in a world where there are no safe havens, no safe havens for our people. The world is a dangerous place, and it's going to get worse before it gets better. How do you plan to deal with the threat of terrorism? First of all, we have to make sure that we have the intelligence and the resources that we need to be able to do that. And that means, as I said, a strong military, which is the best deterrent in the world. It means a strong intelligence community, which is the best counterintelligence in the world. It means an international coalition, which is the best way to go after terrorists who are out there in the world, and that's what we're doing in the war on terrorism. What is your view of the future of the Middle
915;How did President Carter attempt to deal with the nation’s energy crisis?;"In the summer of 1977, Carter was in a state of shock after his reelection in November. The Carter White House had lost its ability to control the news cycle and was in the throes of a crisis of its own making. The economy was faltering, unemployment was skyrocketing, oil prices were high, and the U.S. military was on the verge of collapse. In an effort to save the country, Carter decided to take a page from Ronald Reagan's playbook, which was based on ""shovel-ready, bulldoze-and-conquerel"" solutions to economic problems. On July 1, 1977, President Carter signed Executive Order 11110, which called for the creation of a National Energy Policy and set the goal of reducing America's dependence on foreign oil to 10 percent by the year 2000. This was a bold move at the time, but it would prove prescient in the years to come. What was the impact of the"

I'm going to give my opinion and let the people decide what they think. What do you think is the most important thing to remember about Watergate? It was a very, very sad time in our country and the country was in a very difficult situation at that time. I think we have to learn from that and move on. How would you describe your relationship with President Ford? I had a very good relationship with my father-in-law and he was a very good man to me. We had a lot of fun together as a family. Did you have any close family members who were involved in the Watergate scandal? No, not that I know of. My father-in-law was a very close friend of the Ford family. What was your father-in-law's job at the time of his
917;What effect do you think images such as this one had on Americans who were living or traveling in other countries?;A few years ago, the United States had a lot of trouble with images of war. It was hard to get people to look at the news, and people were afraid of what they saw on the news. I think this has changed a lot in the last 10 or 15 years. The image of war is a lot more palatable to a lot of people than it used to be. What's your favorite photo in the book? My favorite photo is the one of me in the back of a pickup truck with my head in the back of the truck. That's one of the most iconic images of my life. It's a great photo, and I'm glad to have it in the book. How did you come up with the idea for this book? I started thinking about this book in the summer of 2012, and the idea was to write a book about the Vietnam War and how it affected American culture. I wanted to tell the story
918;Write an essay identifying what you believe to be President Carter’s most important foreign policy achievement.;"In the past, this has been a difficult task. The president is known for his ""I told you so"" style, and it's hard to get a straight answer out of him about what he did or didn't do in his first term. So you have to make sure your essay is written in a way that makes him look like a man of the people and not the elite that he is supposed to be. Here are some tips for writing an eloquent essay on Carter's foreign policy achievements: 1. Identify the president's greatest foreign policy achievement and explain why it was so important to the United States. For example, ""The Carter Doctrine"" is a phrase that has come to symbolize the U.S. commitment to human rights and democracy around the world. If you're going to talk about this achievement, it might be best to start with the fact that Carter signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 1978, which made it illegal"
919;New Age movement was;"a reaction to the ""old age"" that came with aging. In the 1960s and 1970s, people began to look for ways to rejuvenate their bodies and minds, and this led to the creation of a new movement known as the ""New Age"" movement. It's important to note that there is no such thing as a ""New Age"" movement, just an umbrella term for a variety of spiritual, health, and lifestyle-related movements that have sprung up over the past 50 years or so. What's the difference between the two movements? Both movements focus on the idea that we are in the midst of a spiritual awakening that will change the world for the better. However, the differences are subtle and not as clear-cut as they are in the case of the Christian right, which claims to be the voice of God on earth. For one thing, the New Age movement is more concerned with personal transformation than evangelism, and its focus is"

922;What new cultural trends affected American society in the 1970s?;A lot of people were starting to think about the role of women in the family, and that's a big change from the past. There was a lot of emphasis on marriage as the institution that would lead to a happy family, and it was very much a man's world at that time. The divorce rate was very high, and women were expected to stay at home with the kids and take care of the house and all that kind of stuff. That changed in the '70s, and women started to have more and more responsibilities and responsibilities that they had to take care of, and that changed the way people looked at their role in the family. How did this change affect the music that was coming out of the U.S. and the rest of the world? I think the first thing that happened was that a lot of bands started getting more experimental and trying to make music that was a little more free-flowing than the kind of rock and roll that
923;How did television in the 1970s reflect society at that time?;I think it was a combination of two things. One was the rise of television as a medium, and the other was the fact that people were watching television in their living rooms and on their couches. Television had become an entertainment medium that was more androgynous and less homoerotic than it had been in the '50s and '60s. The idea of a man and a woman having sex on television was a new thing for a lot of people. It was very new and very new-fangled to be able to do that in a way that was not very explicit, and that made it easier for people to get their heads around what was going on. What was the reaction to this new form of entertainment? There was a lot of backlash, and it was not just in the United States. In Japan, the reaction was much more positive than in the United States. There were a lot of people who felt that this was the way
924;How has popular music and fashion changed since the 1970s?;I'm a fan of fashion, but it's a different world now. People are more aware of what they're wearing and the fashion industry has changed a lot over the last 30 years.

The party had its origins in the Civil War, when Garrison was in the Army of Northern Virginia as a volunteer and fought in the Battle of Fredericksburg, which resulted in the death of General Ulysses S. Grant. In his memoirs, Garrison wrote that ""the Union had to be destroyed, and it was my duty to do my duty.""

931;What kind of economy did conservatives want?;The answer is simple: a free market in everything and everything in its right place. That's what they were fighting for in the 1930s and '40s, and it's what they're fighting for today. What's your take on this debate? Do you agree with those who say the GOP has lost its way?

932;How did Christian evangelicals contribute to a growing conservative national identity?;"It's hard to say, but the most obvious answer is that they helped build a movement that is more than an ideological echo chamber. It's a political and cultural identity, with roots in the Bible and Christian history. In this sense, evangelicalism is the ""other"" of the GOP and the GOP is the ""other"" of the Christian right. And that's a good thing. The other thing is that evangelicals have been able to make their voices heard in the Republican Party for a long time, and that's a good thing. But there's a lot more to this story than that. For one thing, the evangelical vote is a key to the GOP's future. If it loses the evangelical vote, it's going to have a hard time winning elections in the future. For another, it's not just evangelicals who are voting Republican these days. It's the rest of the country as well. A Pew poll last"
933;What impact would the migration patterns shown have on representation in the U.S. House of Representatives?;We find that the number of immigrants who voted in the 2010 election was higher than the number of non-immigrants who voted, and that this effect was driven by a larger share of immigrant voters than of non-immigrant voters. The net effect of immigration on the House of Representatives is positive, but not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level (P =.06). This finding is consistent with the view that immigrants are a net gain for the Democratic Party and the party as a whole, rather than a net loss for the party that loses the election. How do you interpret these results? Our results suggest that the impact of immigration on the political outcomes of the United States is not as simple as it might appear at first glance. Immigrants tend to vote in higher numbers than non-immigrants, but they do not vote at the same rate as native-born Americans. In other words, immigration has a positive effect on the party in power, but not on

935;Reaganomics was;a big part of the reason the U.S. had a strong economy in the 1990s. But that's no longer the case. Today, we're in the throes of a financial crisis that will take years to recover from, and the recovery is going to be slow at best. Inflation is at record highs, interest rates are near zero, and there's no sign of a recovery in the labor market. So what's to blame for this mess? It's hard to say for sure, but one thing is clear: The Federal Reserve has failed to rein in the growth of government spending and the debt that it's driving up. It's not just that the government is spending more than it takes in, but that it's taking in more than it's spending on programs that benefit the middle class and working families. This chart from the Economic Policy Institute shows the difference between what the government spends and what it gets in tax revenue: Photo

""I have no idea who this person is, but it is outrageous that they would stoop to this level of dishonesty in order to advance their anti-Trump agenda,"" he added.

In a Gallup poll conducted last year, for example, more than two-thirds of Republicans said they were ""pro-life,"" compared with less than half of Democrats (48 percent). But there are a number of factors that have changed over the years in the way Americans view abortion, including the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, which legalized abortion in the United States. Since then, the number of abortions has dropped by more than half, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that focuses on reproductive health issues.

943;What was President Reagan’s stance on foreign policy?;Reagan was a strong supporter of the United States' alliance with Great Britain, which was the most powerful of the Western powers at the time. In the 1980s, the Soviet Union began to grow in strength and was able to threaten the West with nuclear weapons. Reagan believed that it was important to maintain a strong alliance with the United States and the West in order to deter Soviet aggression, as well as to protect American citizens and the West's interests in the Middle East. What was the Reagan administration's policy toward the Islamic Republic of Iran? Iran had an active nuclear program, and the United States and the West feared that Iran would develop a nuclear weapon in the next few years. In response to this threat, the Reagan administration imposed sanctions on Iran, which resulted in the closure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and the imposition of trade embargoes on Iranian oil and natural gas. The United States also provided military assistance to the Shah of Iran, who

The Sierra Club's opposition to fracking is part of a broader push by environmental groups to curb fossil fuel use, which is responsible for more than half of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. Environmentalists have been working for years to get Congress to pass a cap-and-trade system that would require polluters to buy permits from each other, rather than the government as a whole.

In a survey of more than 1,000 musicians, we found that the most common reason was a desire to raise money for charity. This was true for all genres of music, but especially for rock and pop, which has a high proportion of low-income musicians. For example, a quarter of rock musicians (25 percent) reported that they were donating their concert proceeds to charity, compared with less than one-tenth of one percent of classical musicians (9 percent). In the same survey, more than a third of rock musicians (37 percent) said their concerts were for ""self-promotion"" and less than one-tenth of one percent said they were for ""social welfare.""

In my research, I've found that there are a number of parallels between the two eras that are worth examining. One of the most important parallels is the rise of white supremacy, which was at its height in the early 20th century.

The atoms in the diagram are arranged in a grid, and each atom has a number on its left and a number on its right. The number on the left is the mass of the atom, and the number on the right is the number of protons and neutrons that make up the atom. In order to get an idea of how these numbers relate to each other, imagine you are looking at a clock and counting the number of seconds it takes to go from one minute to the next.

961;How did the United States and its Western allies finally achieve victory in the Cold War?;"It was a combination of two factors: first, the Soviets were unable to develop a nuclear weapon until the mid-1960s; and second, American intelligence had identified the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons as a threat to the United States and other Western countries in the late 1950s and early 1960s. This led to President Kennedy's ""madman theory"" of nuclear war in 1962, which called for preemptive strikes against Soviet nuclear weapons in case they were used against the United States. The Kennedy administration, along with the British, French, and Israeli governments, believed that a nuclear war would be the worst outcome of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and that it was essential to deter the Soviets from using nuclear weapons in the first place. What was the impact of the nuclear arms race on the world? Nuclear weapons were used in two world wars: World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945). In both wars, the"

The American people have shown that they are willing to stand up for what is right and that they will not back down in the face of threats to our way of life. What is your favorite book of all time? The Bible is my favorite book, but there are a lot of books that I have read over the years. I am a big fan of John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, which is a book about the Spanish-American War in 1898. The Grapes of Wrath tells the story of a group of people who live in the mountains of New Mexico
964;ENIAC was;"a ""dreadful piece of work."" In the end, it was the FBI that came to the rescue, according to the New York Times. The bureau had been tipped off by a tipster who claimed to have seen the film in a movie theater in Los Angeles, and had contacted the FBI to see if they could help. After an investigation, the FBI found that the film was a fake, and had no connection to the 9/11 attacks at all. But that did not stop it from being used as a recruiting tool for al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the terrorist group that carried out the attacks. A few months after the film's release, the US State Department issued a press release stating that ""the United States condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in New York and New Jersey on September 11, 2001, which resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people and injuries to over 7,000 others."""
965;integrated circuit was;a key to the success of the device. In addition to the integrated circuit, there were other components that helped it work: a high-voltage battery that provided power to the microprocessor, an inductor to convert the voltage to current, and capacitors in series and parallel to protect the device from short circuits. These components were designed to work in a variety of configurations, including as part of a circuit, in the form of a capacitor, or on their own. The device was tested at the University of California, Los Angeles, and at a lab in Japan that specializes in electronics and nanoelectronics. The researchers found that the device could perform as well as or better than a commercially available laptop computer when it came to basic arithmetic and memory operations—and that it was more energy efficient than the laptop's built-in battery. A team led by Dr. Yutaka Nakamura, a professor of electrical engineering at UCL, published their findings in
966;Silicon Valley was;"the epicenter of the dot-com bubble. In a report last year, McKinsey & Co. said the region had the highest concentration of venture capital in the world, with $1.5 trillion invested in tech-related companies in the first half of this year. That compares with $890 billion in the United States, according to data compiled by CB Insights. But it's not just Silicon Valley that's booming. New York, San Francisco and Boston are among the fastest-growing cities in the country, as well as some of the most expensive. The cost of living in New York is up more than 20 percent since the recession, while Boston's has gone up nearly 30 percent in the same time period, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ""There's a lot of people who want to live in the city, but they're not willing to pay the price,"" said Mark Kantrowitz, chief executive of real estate"
967;Bill Gates was;one of the most generous philanthropists in the world. But his generosity was a double-edged sword. In many ways, he helped create the world we live in, but at the same time, he made it harder for people to get ahead. Gates has spent his life trying to solve problems that no one thought could be solved. He started a foundation in the 1980s to fund research into cancer, and in the 1990s, he created the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with the goal of improving health around the world. The foundation is a huge success, with $30 billion in donations since its inception in 2000. But it's not without its problems. For one thing, there are a lot of Gates Foundation grants that go to projects that have little to do with health and are not related to Gates' work at all. For a long time, Gates was the face of the foundation, giving speeches and speaking at conferences. But as time went
968;biotechnology was;"the key to a cure for HIV. In the 1980s, scientists discovered that viruses could be used as a drug, which meant they could be injected into the body and cured of HIV. The drug was called AZT, and it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987. But there was a problem: HIV had a gene that made it resistant to the drug. It was called ""HIV-1"", and its resistance was so strong that it could survive for more than 30 years in the body without being destroyed. This was an important breakthrough, but it was not enough to save the lives of people who had HIV. So in the mid-1990s, a team of scientists led by Dr Robert Gallo, a virologist at the University of California, San Francisco, began to look for ways to make the virus less virulent.

969;James Watson was;one of the most prolific writers of his time, with a string of bestsellers. Watson died in 1884 at the age of 72 after a battle with tuberculosis. His works are considered by many to be the first science fiction novels and the foundation of what we know today as science fiction. In this episode we talk to two of his biographers, Robert Silverberg and John Wyndham-Byrne, about their experiences writing about Watson.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Nobel Prizes are awarded every two years to people who have made significant contributions to science In a statement, the Royal Society said: ""We are saddened by the passing of Sir Martin Rees, one of the most eminent scientists of his generation. ""His work was a key factor in the development of the molecular biology of life and has led to a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie disease and disease-causing processes."" Sir Martin Rees (1927-2013) Born in the Isle of Wight, Rees studied physics at Cambridge before going on to earn a doctorate in biophysics at the University of Cambridge in 1955. He was a pioneer of the field of molecular biology, which is based on the study"
971;Explain how scientific discoveries in biotechnology have improved people’s lives.;The most important thing to understand about this is that it is a question of what we are willing to pay for a better life. The cost of living in the 21st century is much higher than it was in the 20th, and that is a good thing. We have more information, better health care, a more educated workforce—all of which are going to make life better for more people. But there is no question that the benefits of this are not evenly distributed. In some places, people are getting worse, and in some places, people are getting better. That is the nature of science, and it is what science is all about. How do you respond to critics who say that your research does not have a moral or ethical dimension? I am a scientist, not a moralist. If I were to write a book that was moral, I would have to make a moral argument for the book, and that would be a difficult thing to do. But
972;How have personal computers transformed the workplace?;In the past, people worked in their basements, and there was no computer to speak of. Today, we have a lot of computers in our office, which is great for people who are used to working from home. But the fact of the matter is that computers have changed the way we work. They're more efficient, and they allow us to do things that we couldn't do before—such as write a blog, for example. What's the best advice you've received about computer use? It's a tough question to answer, because I'm a computer geek, and my wife is a computer geek as well. But one thing is for sure: If you're going to use a computer, make sure it's the right one for the job. And that means getting a good computer with lots of memory, a good hard drive, and a good graphics card. You can get all that for a couple hundred dollars on eBay, or you can go to
973;How have advances in telecommunications and the rise of the Internet affected the standard of living in the United States?;A number of factors have contributed to the standard of living in the United States. First, there is no longer a monopoly on the production of goods and services, which is one of the reasons why we have so much consumer choice. Second, the cost of living has risen dramatically over the past 30 years, as a result of rising productivity and technological change. In other words, it is no longer possible to live in a house that costs $100,000 a year and has a pool in the backyard, but a house that costs $1,000,000 and is surrounded by water and electricity is a better value for the consumer. What is the most important factor that has helped the standard of living in the United States? The fact that our economy is based on trade, not government intervention, is a major factor. The growth of the trade deficit in the 1990s and 2000s was the most important factor in the increase in the standard of living. This trade deficit

The organization has a mission of ""helping people in need, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, national origin, physical or mental disability, veteran status, or any other factor that makes them vulnerable to homelessness,"" according to its website. A spokesman for AmeriCorps did not return a request for comment. In an interview with The Associated Press last year, President Barack Obama said he was ""proud"" of the military service of his daughters and son-in-law. But he did not offer any examples of the kind of service they provided during his time in office. ""I think it's fair to say that my daughters and my son-in-law served our country with distinction,"" Obama said at the time.

976;Contract with America was;"the first to offer a $1,000 bonus for every dollar spent on the product. In addition to the cash bonuses, American also offered an annual membership to the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AAND), a group of dietitians who specialize in weight management, as well as a free copy of their book, ""Diet for a New America."" The program, which began in 1999, has grown to more than 3,000 members, according to American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics president and co-founder Marion Nestle. Nestle said members spend an average of $5,000 a year on the program, which is offered in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. Nestle, a professor of nutrition at New York University, told ABC News that her organization is ""trying to get the word out about this program and how it's helping people lose weight."" ""I think it's a great program,"" she said."
977;Kenneth Starr was;"a lawyer for the Clinton White House. In an interview with Fox News' Megyn Kelly, he said the investigation was ""unfair"" and a ""witch hunt."" Starr, who served as special counsel to the Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, said he had no role in the decision to fire Comey, but that it was his ""responsibility"" to do so. ""I'm the one who made the decision, and that's what I have to live with,"" he said. The Justice Department inspector general is conducting an investigation into the firings, according to a person familiar with the matter. Comey's ouster comes amid a string of high-profile controversies that have roiled the Trump administration, including the firing of FBI Director James Comey, who was overseeing the Russia investigation. Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. ___ 10:45 a.m."
978;Dayton Accords was;"a ""fantasy,"" he said. The Dayton agreement would have allowed Dayton to take control of the University of Dayton and its $1.8 billion endowment without the need for a vote of the Board of Trustees. Dayton had said he wanted to sell the university to a private investor for a price that would be less than the value of the endowment, which is estimated at $1.8 billion. In his letter to university President Mark Cavanagh, Schoen wrote that ""there is no evidence that the Board of Trustees is in the best interest of the University of Dayton or Dayton students, faculty, staff or alumni."" Schoen's letter was signed by three trustees who are in their 30s and one who is in his 50s. The board is made up of seven members, and all of them are over the age of 65. ""I am writing to express my concern about the direction of the Board of Trustees and their"
979;Explain why the federal government shut down in 199;"Explain why the federal government shut down in 199?

A lot of people have a hard time understanding the shutdown, which was triggered by Republicans' refusal to raise the debt ceiling, a move that would have required the Treasury to borrow $16.7 trillion from the Federal Reserve and pay interest on that debt. The GOP was trying to defund Planned Parenthood, which provides birth control and cancer screenings to low-income women and their unborn children. It was an attempt to force President Obama to sign a health care bill that would have defunded the women's health organization for one year.

Why did Republicans want to shut down the government?

In a word: money. Republicans had spent the better part of a decade railing against the government spending that was taking place in the Obama administration, and they felt that Obama was using the power of the federal government to do things that they did not like. The shutdown was a way for Republicans to say, ""You know what? This is what we want, and we're going to take"
980;What government policies helped create the U.S. prosperity of the 1990s?;"A lot of it was the Federal Reserve, which created a bubble in housing, which led to the housing bubble and the subprime mortgage crisis. But there were a lot of things that government did to make life better for working people, like health care, food stamps, unemployment insurance, child care, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which is a tax credit for low-income people who work full-time, paid for by the government. The EITC has grown from $1.3 billion in 1996 to $7.2 billion in 2013, and that's a lot of money to give to people who have no income at all. What is your take on the Occupy Wall Street movement? Do you think it's a good thing or a bad thing? Occupy Wall Street is an attempt to take the power away from the 1 percent and give it to the 99 percent.

981;Why was President Clinton able to win re-election in 1996?;"The answer is simple: He ran a campaign that was based on the belief that people were looking for change, and that change was coming to the United States. And it did. In the 1990s, there was a lot of talk about ""welfare reform,"" which was an attempt to make it easier for people to get welfare benefits and less onerous for them to do so. The Clinton administration did a lot of work on that, and I'm sure it had a lot to do with the fact that Bill Clinton was a Democrat, and that was one of the reasons he was able to get re-elected. What was the most important issue that you worked on as a member of the House of Representatives? The most important issue was health care. We had a very difficult time getting the bill passed in the House, and the Senate was even more difficult. But we did get health care passed, and that was a big part of my job as a"

983;Al Gore was;"the first to call for a moratorium on fracking. In an op-ed for the New York Times, Gore said the industry ""has a responsibility to clean up its act, not just in the United States but around the world as well."" Gore's call for a moratorium came after a series of earthquakes in the Marcellus Shale, which is responsible for much of the country's natural gas production. The U.S. Geological Survey reported last year that there had been at least 10 tremors in the area since April, and more are expected to come in the next few months. ""We are in uncharted territory,"" Gore said in the Times op-ed. ""It is time for the industry to take a long, hard look at what it is doing and stop the practice that is polluting our water and air, threatening our climate and putting at risk public health and the health of our children.""

984;George W. Bush was;"the first to use the term ""global war on terror"" in a State of the Union address. But it's a term that has taken on a life of its own, with its own lexicon, meaning and connotative meaning. The Bush administration, for example, has referred to the war on terror as a ""new form of warfare"" and ""an all-out assault on the United States and its allies."" In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of the term ""Islamic State"" to describe the group that has seized large swaths of Iraq and Syria, as well as parts of neighboring countries such as Turkey that are home to millions of Syrian refugees. ""I think it's fair to say that the term 'Islamic State' has become a kind of catchall,"" said Peter Bergen, who served as national security adviser to President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2005. Bergen is now a CNN national security analyst."
985;Ralph Nader was;"the first to call for a recount in Wisconsin. Nader's recount petition garnered 1.5 million signatures, but the Green Party did not have enough money to pay for it. It's unclear how much money they have in the bank, but it's a safe bet that they have more than enough to do the recount. In a statement to NBC News, Jill Stein said, ""This is a victory for the millions of Americans who fought to make our democracy work, and it's a vindication of the work we did in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania."" Stein has been running for president since 2012, and is a long-shot candidate in the general election. But she's made a name for herself as a crusader against the power of money in politics and for campaign finance reform. The campaign for a recount in Wisconsin was led by a group called Our Revolution, which is led by Sanders' wife, Jane Sanders. The group's executive director"
986;What did the Supreme Court decide in Bush v. Gore?;The Court ruled 5-4 that there was no violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which required states with a history of discrimination to get preclearance from the Justice Department before changing their voting laws. In doing so, the Court overturned a lower court ruling that had found Florida's voter ID law to be a violation of the VRA. What's the case about? The case is Shelby County v. Holder, in which the Supreme Court will decide whether or not the federal government can force states to comply with Section 5 of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), which requires states to maintain voter rolls that are free of noncitizens who have registered to vote in the past, as well as felons and the mentally incapacitated. Who is the plaintiff? Shelby County, Alabama, is one of the most conservative counties in the United States. It has a population of less than 10,000, and the majority of its residents
987;What caused the vote-count controversy in Florida in the 2000 election?;A group of lawyers, led by Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, filed a lawsuit to block President Bush from certifying the results of the presidential election, which was held Nov. 8, 2000. The lawsuit was based on the theory that Florida's electoral votes should have been counted in accordance with the state's laws and procedures for counting votes. Bush won Florida by a margin of more than 2.5 million votes, but his re-election was challenged in federal court by Gore supporters, who argued that the election was marred by fraud and voter suppression. How did this lawsuit come to be? Bondi, a Republican appointee to the U.S. Supreme Court, was the state's attorney general from 1999 to 2003. In 2003, she became one of the most powerful lawyers in the country, with a $100,000-a-year salary that included a share of her office's budget. She had previously served as a federal prosecutor in New

989;By how many votes was Gore leading when news networks declared him the winner in Florida? What was Bush’s lead when networks declared him to be the winner?;The answer is, none of the above. Bush won the popular vote by 1.5 million votes, but his Electoral College victory was a mere 0.1 percent of the popular vote. This is not to say that there is no reason to be concerned about the integrity of the electoral process. It is important to understand that, as long as the system is working as it should, we have no reason to believe that it is rigged against our interests. In other words, the election results are the result of a free and fair election, not an attempt to rig the system in favor of one candidate or the other. But there is a more fundamental problem with the way in which we elect our representatives to public office that needs to be addressed before we move on to other issues. This is the fact that our political system is based on the assumption that people are rational actors and that their decisions are guided by rational deliberation. This assumption is wrong, at least in the

991;Osama bin Laden was;"a ""lone wolf."" In the interview, he said the United States should have taken action against al Shabaab in Somalia, which has killed hundreds of U.S. troops and is linked to al Qaeda. ""I think it's a mistake to go to war with a group that's not part of the war on terror,"" he said. Obama's comments were the latest in a series of comments by the White House that have raised questions about the president's willingness to use military force in the Middle East without congressional approval. The administration has been under pressure from Republicans in Congress to go after Islamic State and other groups that it says pose a threat to the United States and its allies. Obama, speaking at the National Defense University in Washington, said he was ""deeply concerned"" about the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS or ISIL), but he did not rule out the possibility of a ground invasion of the group's"
992;al-Qaeda was;"the most powerful of the groups. In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in September, al-Maliki said the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which controls large swathes of Iraq and Syria, would be defeated by ""a coalition of the willing and the determined,"" but did not provide details. ""We have no choice but to fight the ISIL, but it is our duty to protect our people and our country,"" he said at the U.N. Security Council on Sept. 19. Al-Maliki's comments were in line with those of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who said in an interview with Reuters last week that ISIL's loss of territory was a ""game changer"" and ""the end of the caliphate."" But analysts say the battle for Tikrit is far from over. ""There is a lot of fighting to be done,"" said Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the"
993;anthrax was;the first to show up in the U.S. and it's a big deal. The bacterium has the ability to kill up to 90 percent of bacteria, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That's why you need to wash your hands after you eat, bathe in water with chlorine or use a dishwasher, CDC says. But there's no way to know how many people are at risk for the bacteria until researchers get a better handle on the number of people in the U.S. who have it. That's why a team of microbiologists led by Dr. Robert Stapleton of the University of California, San Franciso is trying to figure out what's causing the spike in cases, which they've dubbed Legionnaires' disease. Stapleton's team collected samples from more than 1,000 people, and found that the most common source of Legionnaires' is exposure to sewage, which is a problem
994;Explain how the United States responded to the attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C.;What was the response of the international community? President Bush said the attacks were an act of terror and a war against the United States. He ordered the military to hunt down and destroy al Qaeda and its allies in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Bush administration was concerned that a terrorist attack could have a destabilizing effect on the Middle East and North Africa, which were at the center of the Cold War. In addition, the United States had to deal with the threat of nuclear proliferation in the Persian Gulf region. How did the attacks affect U.S. foreign policy? The attacks were a wake-up call to the world that the United States was a target of terrorist attacks. It was the first time in American history that an attack on the United States was carried out by a foreign power. The attacks caused a change in the balance of power in the Middle East and the world's attention was drawn to the region. What were the consequences of the attacks?
995;Why does American foreign policy anger Islamic fundamentalists in the Middle East?;It's a combination of two things: first, the United States is a country that has a lot of influence over the Muslim world, and second, there's a sense of American exceptionalism in the Muslim world. The U.S. is the most powerful country in the world, and we have the most to lose if things go wrong. That's why they're angry at us. How does this relate to your book? I've written a lot about this in the past, but this is the first time I've been able to put it into a book. It's not just a book about the Muslim world, but a book about American foreign policy in the Middle East. What's the relationship between America's military intervention in Iraq and the rise of ISIS? The Iraq War was one of the most disastrous foreign policy blunders in American history. It led to the rise of al-Qaeda in Iraq, which is the most dangerous terrorist organization
996;What factors have contributed to the rise of Middle Eastern terrorist groups?;In the past, there was a tendency to think that the Arab Spring was a result of Western meddling in the region. However, this is no longer the case. It is clear that the region has been destabilized by decades of military and economic sanctions, which have made it difficult for the region to develop a democratic system and the rule of law. This, in turn, has led to the rise of extremist groups such as al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), which have taken advantage of the chaos to expand their influence in the region. What is the most important lesson to be learned from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)? The most important lesson is that we need to be careful about what we wish for and how we wish for it to happen. In this case, what we have seen is an escalation of sectarian and ethnic tensions, as well as a lack of political and economic reform. The result has been a series
