";"How did physical geography impact industrial growth?

As part of the growth strategy published in 2010 by the U.S. Department of Energy under the Center for Energy and Carbon Research, researchers measured energy demand by assessing the effects of different physical landscapes on production energy. The first field research into how plants could change their productivity depended on measuring the impact of different physical landscapes across the U.S.

""The first thing we're doing is going to measure changes in carbon footprint across various areas of the global climate systemâ€”from the Northern Hemisphere to Antarctica,"" says lead researcher Daniel Ebersling at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. ""This is another way that we'll quantify what we measure. I know that I'm not alone with that in my ability to do that. We're doing an exercise and it's not actually in my area of interest.""

Ebersling, now professor of geophysics at Duke University and a consultant on the program, began looking into the relationship between urban life and energy use in the early 1990s, beginning in the early 1990s with a project called Ecography: Climate Change.

""I have to tell you the things I think happened over the last three decades in terms of our country's environmental impact is really unique,"" Ebersling says in the video below. ""They have been happening over the past 14-16 years in the same way many different people have experienced their lives.""
