Physical geography has also hindered growth of technology and technology products

According to David Shiner at the University of Reading. They argue that ""the physical geography of the world … increases the competition for capital in many key sectors, including banking and insurance — both of which are increasingly linked with the economic health of a country and its surroundings, which further contribute to economic growth.""

Governments, corporations, businesses and other private sector actors all work on different physical maps, which means that they rely more on one geographic area than they can on other geographic areas. Thus geography affects innovation, which is critical in many important sectors such as medical care, government and the manufacturing industry

Research and development for industrial health projects has focused on geography, especially within emerging and emerging economies (such as China), but with its impact also limited (as it will be with all the large-scale technology development and infrastructure projects in the industrial world, this should only be the beginning).

Some people use it but the main source is for your site and your business and you should write your own articles on it. That way, if people are reading and disagree with your article, you know it's not true. It would have to be your source.

In the past, when companies decided to build from scratch, your article was their own creation. They decided on how to sell it that way.
